0,"Charged for “Resort Fee” each day (45$) && didn’t even use the gym or the pool, feel like we should only get charge one fee for the whole stay not each day or if we actually use the facilities (which we didn’t) NO coffee machine in our suite?? probably cause there was so much coffee shops around the casino, but who wants to wait in line? & checkout?? Why no checkout option on the TV? Would be easier than email, just went with the text option..."
1,No kettle in room.
2,Too fancy and very crowded! The pool was too crowded. People started going to pool at 8:00 a.m.
3,"Not much, if anything then they should provide some basic things like tooth paste and atleast a small bottle of water per day."
4,"Staff are not helpful. Everyone I talked here don’t seem to be happy. 
I like the room but hotel is too big to figure out where I was.
I had to take three or four elevators from garage to the room."
5,"It cost a small fortune to stay there yet we were not given enough information about our stay, where facilities were and how to get our inclusive breakfast. It’s basically a shopping mall with a hotel attached and they do not look after guests enough."
6,"There is no individual approach to guests, which is usually not very large hotels. Any water in the room-paid. It is not possible to use the refrigerator in the room, as the mini-bar works in automatic mode."
7,I didn’t appreciate housekeeping saying they don’t clean rooms on Sundays only the rooms where people check out.  I go to Vegas often and have never experienced anything like that and was very upset when I returned to my room at 2 am and it wasn’t clean.  I hate sleeping in an unmade bed.  I called housekeeping that night and asked to speak with a manager and was kept on hold so long... I eventually hung up.  I called the front desk later that morning and was told housekeeping made that up and they would come and clean the room but that didn’t make up for the day they missed cleaning up.  I paid too much money to not have my room cleaned.  I’m not sure if I will stay at the Venetian again or not just because of that experience.
8,"The view of the “standard” rooms are ugly (on the roof pf a warehouse)
Be careful - Don’t  remove anything from the minibar otherwise you will be charged for at checkout (it’s an electronic sensor). Fortunately we were able to be reimbursed of what we did not consume
The prices of the F&B are extremely high
Pool overcrowded- impossible to find 2 seats after 11am"
9,"Not enough towels in room, had to call.  No toiletries, had to call.  The lighting in the bathroom and room is terrible.  The shower was not very good.  Clean and nice but the pressure was bad.  Not up to the cost."
10,"The only thing was the toilet paper was almost too big to fit the feeder, making it hard to pull it out."
11,I took out 6 drinks from the fridge in order to put in my juice that I use to take my meds. I left the drinks sodas in the table and they were removed from the room and I was charged for them. I called the front desk and was told that because the drinks were taken out of the fridge I would have to pay for them. I did not see a sign stating this. I had to call the day and was finally credited this amount.
12,The restaurant Chica the food was not good i didn’t like the food i ordered didn’t eat it & still got charged for it... never going back to that restaurant
13,nobody helping with the luggage upon arrival. nobody helping with luggage after check-in even though the room is a 8 min walk from the lobby. airport shuttle not available early in the AM. And on top the internet in the room was super slow and sometimes not working at all.
14,Cleaning could have been better for a five stars hotel. There were stains in the bathrobe and on the head of the bed. The WLAN was not always stable. Long walking distance between parking and hotel room.
15,"Overpriced, slightly worn out. “Breakfast” included is actually not a hotel buffet breakfast but a grab-to-go package with coffee and pastry"
16,"My credit card was charged for initial deposit (fair!) but at check out i was charged full amount with no explanation. It was only on return home that i looked at the credit card and found out about the excess charge. On contacting them i was told the deposit would be returned after 1 week. I think this is unfair and indirect way of making interest money.
NO KETTLE in the room & we were charged $10 per kettle (2 rooms). Outrageous! 
My child had vomited night before and on return following day from Grand canyon, the stench in the room was intense and we had to clean the carpet again (was past midnight). 
Overall disappointed. Never again"
17,Just about everything.  Really not handicapped accommodating.
18,"The Breakfast is a shame for a 5 stars hôtel. We booked the room with breakfast hoping to have a buffet like every standard hotel do. But in the Venetian they give you a coupon to go to à small bakery to get a little box to grab and go ! I was desappointed and upset, we had to breakfast some where else."
19,view was crapy and we asked for adjoining room with friends which we didn't get even though it was promised
20,"View was poor from a lower level room we were given. 
Bedding was too hot. Could do with a lighter quilt this time of year (spring coming into summer)."
21,"No coffee maker. I know Vegas isn't known for being cheap, but considering all the luxurious amenities in these suites, it's silly that I can't make a cup of coffee when I wake up. Instead you have to get dressed & walk down to the casino floor for coffee. I'd give up the TV in the bathroom for a cheap coffee maker."
22,We paid to upgrade the view from our room at $50 a night and it wasn't even remotely worth that. Our bags took 30 mins to arrive in our room and 30 mins to emerge again when we left.
23,The only issue was when we checked in; we had to wait over an hour for our luggage to be brought to our room.
24,Service at Canonita was horrid.  Food was decent.
25,It’s inconvenient to take elevator from one building to another to reach your room from the check in floor.
26,"No facilities for coffee/ tea or hot drinks of any kind. Take care as mini-bar and associated snacks are expensive and get charged to your room if they get picked up (eg if you want to see what they are). When we arrived there was no price list (it appeared after cleaning on the 2nd day). 
Room service is available (for a fee though) and plenty of bars downstairs - I was just dying for a good cup of tea!!"
27,"It is not a family friendly hotel, I asked for a kettle to warm by baby's milk and they charged USD 10 for it. The amount is not much when you are staying at this hotel but you find it very ridiculous."
28,"Hotel was far too big. Was too hectic and wasn’t easy to get to the lifts to get up to your suite! Also, hated the fact people can smoke inside! Could smell smoke on our floor and we hate the smell of people smoking!"
29,"I mean it's Vegas, everything is expensive and to go anywhere you have to walk through a Casino. It take forever just to go from the room to the strip."
30,NOTHING
31,Every staff member in the casino area (excluding cocktail servers) we tried to approach were extremely rude
32,In room advertisement on what I believe was an internal hotel channel of a young woman soliciting viewers offering intimate communications was offensive.
33,"Had to call housekeeping in the evening as the room wasn’t made
Breakfast included is a rip off, you had better go and have breakfast at McDonald than take that option 
Paid extra charge at check in to have a view of the strip, we had a view of Trump tower..."
34,"39 Dollar resort fee a night dies not give you access tithe spa - not even the simplest sauna
You walk miles in this hotel - badly organized 
Staff is alright but not first class
Hotel apart from the architecture is not much different or unique than most other Strip hotels"
35,First room not cleaned properly and smelled of tobacco. Switched rooms and new room was great
36,The fridge should have room for our personal items. And no coffee maker. And lamps near bed should have plug outlet.
37,"Everything at the Venetian was exceeded our expectations. The only downside was the check-in experience. The Venetian had not received the reservation we had made through Booking and we had to wait for Booking to resolve the issue with their reservations department. After an hour wait, the Venetian was nice enough to give us a room at a much cheaper rate than the one booked through Booking while Booking worked on our reservation, which they were able to solve about 3 hours after hour arrival. It may not seem important but after traveling for 20+ hours check-in experience is almost as important as the stay itself.  This is the first time I had issues with Booking but I received not apology or compensation for such a hassle."
38,"Be aware that most US hotels and especially in Las Vegas will charge you for the room even though booking.com lists these as ""free cancellation"".  The cancellation may be free but your room will get charged and receiving a credit for the charge takes days (in most cases).  This has happened to me now several times and it is very inconvenient when I have to ""argue"" with the hotel reception about removing the ""deposit"" charge because the room was intended to be held with one credit card and paid by another. 
This time at the Venetian the receptionist insisted that the charge had been made by booking.com and that the room was prepaid and could not changed.  Only after speaking to his manager the prepayment (which was charged by The Venetian) was removed.  But it will now take several days until my credit card is refunded. 
Maybe booking.com has this point listed in small print somewhere, but advertising these rooms as ""free cancellation"" does not really paint the whole picture.  Outside of the United States the ""free cancellation"" works exactly as noted.  And probably one of the main reasons I continue to book my hotels through booking.com."
39,"The view from the room could have been better, there is an option to upgrade to get the better view however."
40,"Given the price, I expected at least complementary water but none was provided. Minibar was weighted, so you couldn't take anything out if you wanted to store your own stuff as you would get charged. Sometimes the smell of smoke from the casino floor would reach the room."
41,"Poor signs from self parking to main reception, especially due to the size of the hotel."
42,"It was a bit hard to get in and out of the hotel. We had to take two elevators and cross a bridge :) . 
Same with the Casino, hard to find the exit, but I'm pretty sure that one is on purpose. The room didn't have any slippers which I think is very basic for such a hotel. Towels were super rough and hurt my skin."
43,"If I had to be super picky, and I am being picky, for a luxury hotel:
- seats in the Venetian reception area would be good for those with mobility issues to take a rest whilst checking in
- the one area that wasn't clean in the room were the phones, covered in dust but there again these aren't used as much I suspect these days
- am not a fan of the in room minibar on a weighted tray.
- no complimentary water or coffee machine
- small, upright in room safe. Would prefer a larger, flat laptop sized safe
- towels are small (especially after you've eaten all the good food downstairs!)"
44,Lady at the dront desk was a little aggressive about our view of the room. Our view ended up looking at the AC system of the building. We had 2 rooms and she said they are right accors each other and they were not! but luckily we were in the same floor! Cut restaurant in same resort was terrible! I felt like I eat a charcoal when I asked for a well done steak and it does NOT worth the money you pay
45,Nothing. It will be hard to find something one do not like here.
46,That I had to go home!
47,"No respect to the clients. Will not recommend at all and will not be back. I can explain why.  I stayed in hotel 3 days. I paid total about 1200$, so 400$ per day. And you guys can't provide bath slippers for your clients for this amount? Really? I was so surprised about it after moved in, i made a call on reception to say that there is no slippers, and answer was ""they are not supposed to be there"". Really? For 400$ per day i have to go to bath and then walk on the dirty floor without the slippers? Okay, they said ""we gonna deliver it by your request, wait please 15 min"". I was waiting, and nothing was happen in 30 min, i get to shower, i get out of shower and just then, in 50 min totally i get my slippers) even in cheap 3 stars hotel they providing it, i just can't understand why Venezian acting with no respect and so cheap. 
Second reason that makes me disappointed even more, its additional charges. After moved in I realized that there is no water heater inside as well, i need it for my special herbal tea. I got a call on front desk and they say ""it's not include but you can get it for 7.50$"". So, i paid to Venezian 7.50$ plus tips to rent a water heater that totally cost on market even less than 7.50$) Nice move guys. So, of course problem not in 7.50$, thanks God i can handle it, problem in respect that you not feel at all from Venezian staff, especially when you ordering lux room for that amount of money. I know that it's all about business but there is tonns of ways to make money beside to safe it on slippers, they cost less than 50 cents... 
p.s. Thank you for not charging me for the air."
48,"Our view wasn't the best, despite booking a strip view room. It is a smoking casino and the smell of smoke gets into the corridors and elevators. Not good for non smokers"
49,"Outdated furniture, no coffee maker/ keurig. No view of the Stip. wanted additional $45 to get a View. I paid less in other hotels with the strip view."
50,"Having to walk through the casino to get to the room elevator banks.  The smell of smoke in the casinos, but that's Vegas."
51,Be prepared to spend a lot for food and activities if you stay mostly in the resort.
52,"We used the minibar to store our bottles of water. It was small, so we had to move the bottles inside. Because of that, the system mistakingly identified that we had opened a bottle of champagne, and charged $55. Fortunately, at checkout they confirmed if we did that (which we didn't), and reimbursed my credit card."
53,"It's so big, it takes about 5 minutes to walk to your room from the entrance :)"
54,"I mean this is not Encore and not brand new, but I don't see the appeal of Bellagio when price difference is so much"
55,"Staff was very rude. My wife asked for kettle to heat up water for my 1 year old. We were told by the staff,""I don't know where all you have stayed before, but at The Venetian we charge for kettle"". I was happy to pay the charge, without them making such rude remarks."
56,"It does not feel like a 5* Hotel at any point, more like an average 4*.
The reception staff (as well as the hotel via email) was quite pushy asking us to upgrade and since we didn’t feel the need we ended up at the back of the hotel directly on top of the casino vent which made an insufferable 24h noise making impossible to sleep. While the host that did our check in was ok, the attitude of the rest of the staff by the reception (not attending at that point) was childish, noisy and definitely not what you expect from a 5* Hotel where you expect everything to be mint end to end.
The rooms are very big and astonishing, though the electric curtains on our room didn’t work. The bathroom is huge but the toilet doors didn’t close properly...it’s in general quite worn out. In terms of room amenities you expect in a 4*+ Hotel you will not fond here. Nothing to polish your shoes, no toothbrush, no paste, no comb, no razor...really nothing! The hairdryer is as powerful as the battery on my watch so bring you own if you want my advice. 
The icing in the cake for me was the pool being closed for the season! The resort fee for the Venetian/Palazzo is the highest of the Strip yet all the other hotels down the strip had the full resort and pools open and heated and the Venetian didn’t, very disappointing. 
All in all, we were in Vegas for our honeymoon and wanted to treat ourselves going to “the best”...probably should have gone for the sure bets!"
57,"Couldn't connect to their internet.  Didn't want to wait on hold for IT when on vacation so went without internet.  Still it is nice to get away from the digital world.  However if paying a 39 dollar a day resort fee, I think the IT could be a little faster.  Maybe a little better education at check in."
58,"I booked this hotel on booking.com , which includes breakfast everyday. I paid about AUD$60 per day for this breakfast and I was expecting a buffet or at least a continental breakfast.
However I was kicked out of the restaurant in the first morning because the AUD$60 breakfast only includes 4 mini muffins and a tiny fruit salad X 2.  I felt so pissed off.  In the next morning, it was even worse as there was no staff at the restaurant door to give me the AUD$60 mini muffins. I went into the this restaurant, to order a hot buffet breakfast . You know what? It was only USD$20 each.
 I complained to booking.com and its customer service sucks. One email said she will reply to me within 7 days, and then no more response in 2 weeks until I contacted book.com again and again. Booking.com denied any responsibility of any booking on its website and refuse to give refund of the overcharged breakfast."
59,"The breakfast option in the room charge was for TWO people regardless of how many are staying and consists of a ""grab and go"" Danish/fruit cup/coffee for two. No flexibility but fine if you like this style."
60,"Wifi very poor in rooms and throughout hotel, dirty plates left outside our door for hours. Our room key became faulty every night of our stay and we were sat outside our hotel room waiting for security to issue a new key for up to 20mins. No bottle opener in room despite there being a mini bar. In the grand scheme, there's are small issues but when you pay so much to stay there it is unacceptable."
61,My only complaint is having to walk through the smoke-filled casino to reach our room. Yuck!
62,"Housekeeping a bit slow, had to ask to have room done already after 3pm. Properly huge - confusing to navigate.
Disappointed that we couldn’t upgrade room."
63,"The hotel is too big and doesn't work for people that have trouble walking long distance like my mom, very crowded. Located almost at the end of the strip"
64,The valet parking was very unfriendly; valet drivers were standing idly in the center and failing to provide basic guidance (as compared to Palazzo).
65,Too much smoke in the casino.  Non-smokers need their own area to breathe easier.
66,Such a long way to find the check in counter and the hotel room. Poor breakfast. No coffee maker in room
67,There was nothing not to like! It was a great hotel!
68,The room is quite dark. Checkin wait is usually long.
69,Breakfast was include in Booking.com but there was no enough information about the breakfast. I saw details about the breakfast after confirmation. It was to late to cancel the breakfast.
70,"The toilet paper was horrendous. I have had better TP at the local park. Also, there is no coffee maker in the room.
I got charged $95 because I picked something up from the dresser. Apparently there are weight sensors on the tray and you get charged anytime you pick an item up (regardless of whether you actually used it). I had to call the front desk to have the charge removed. 
I was woke up in the middle of the night by someone's toilet flushing in the next room and by loud, crude guests in the hallway. I was uneasy about how clearly I could hear their basic conversations as I tried to fall back asleep.
I paid an extra $45 for a ""Strip view"" which consisted of a bunch of roofs and less than half a block of the strip where nothing was actually happening.
This hotel is all looks and no real substance. It was absolutely not worth the money. Next time I will stay at the Bellagio."
71,"Parking lot no surveillance cameras, because my car was hit in the parking lot and the incitee escaped，let me feel bad😡"
72,"1. The breakfast was really disappointing (for extra 47 GBP for two nights to get three tiny pastries in the paper box and a paper cup of tea/coffee which you have to pick up from the bakery as takeaway without even possibility to sit and eat properly for such high class hotel as The Venetian was very very very disappointing - never book breakfast included in your room rate there).
2. The thing that mini bar and some snacks & drinks at the table are electronically controlled makes check out easier, but the matter that you are charged even if you took it to check and then placed back is a bit anoying.
3. No complimentary water in the room, even branded with the hotel name 0,5l water bottle is charged.
4. There weren't slippers in the room, which is kind of ok for lower rated hotels, but for The Venetian!..."
73,No room in refrigerator for personal use..would have loved coffee facilities in room.
74,The maids woke me up twice at 11am and 11:30am when I had 6pm late checkout.
75,"When I booked the suite ( which was very expensive) i was expecting a view , which didn´t had , when I booked it on booking, the photos showed there was a view, I felt a lil scammed by this."
76,The smoke.  The bedrooms also had a smoke smell.  If it is the “filtered” air then they need to figure a different way to recycle the air.  Will not be able to return because of the smoke.
77,Left turn traffic light outside self parking drive way is tooo slow. Every time need to wait for a long time especially heavy traffic.
78,"No space in there mini fridge for personal use .  You move the item in the mini bar, you .
No coffee pot or tea for early or late night drink, you have to order and PAY.
I wanted to borrow 2 small plates and fork,  I was told I'll be charged for this service. ( they forgot, the charged $39 resort fee per night) and. Since they busy, I have to wait for one hour.
We were in the non- smoking area rooms but at night, we can smell the cigarettes smoke."
79,It is a very big hotel and confusing to get around.
80,"For breakfast we got some food in a box to take it with us, we hoped we could sit down in a restaurant for the money we payed."
81,The service received from the bellman & valet when leaving the property were horrible.
82,allowing pets .
83,Breakfast! Well below my expectations for a five star hotel. A bag of danishes to take away to your room or to find a place to eat. Parking was a nightmare. Hard to find a spot on your own and 15 minutes to an hour wait to get your car from valet.
84,We saw last guest left their shopping bags and trash inside the closet...so we called the house keeping. They shows up quickly and clean up immediately.
85,"The breakfast included is a joke, you don’t have any choice for what to choose and it is totally not worth it. Don’t choose the room with breakfast included."
86,The room was non smoking. We reported a horrible cigarette smoke smell in the toilet room and the hotel brought an air filter. It did not work. Still smelled badly.
87,One bad thing is the speech of wifi. It is too slow to watch videos.
88,We had wanted to spend some time at the spa but it seems to book up quick for couples retreats.
89,Really wish Las Vegas would enforce a smoking ban inside the casinos.
90,"As a suite, the living room side is not very useful as it is completely open to the bedroom.  Just a very large hotel room and not really a suite where one can go and not disturb another.  The furniture in the living room are was not very comfortable.  I also can't believe the sensor mini bars still exist and was disappointed to see this hotel had this type of system.  You can not look at anything or read ingredients to see if you want it as if you move it you bought it.  Very cheap toilet paper, stiff robe, cheap toiletries and useless hair dryer for the price you pay for this hotel.  In Vegas you can get good accommodations for much more reasonable price.  Expected a little more for the cost of this hotel but was pretty standard to an average hotel.  In the Canal shops you are harassed constantly by people trying to sell you show tickets or drag you into their cosmetics shops and put their crap on you.  Was very annoying and hated whenever we had to walk through the canal shops to the room and could not just leisurely walk around and shop without aggressive sales people constantly coming after you."
91,"A little desappointed by some services, that are usually free in a hotel of this class. 
No free bottle of water (even small!!) has been offered in the room, what is definitely not normal!!"
92,Would be greater if more direction guidance could be given because it’s a little bit confusing between the Casino and the main entrance.
93,I drove with the Tesla to The Venetian and I asked for it to be charged and it didn’t happend . The valet told me he can charg it for me but he didn’t do it .
94,"The Check-in staff were not nice, originally gave us the wrong room, gave us the wrong directions to our room. When we went back to straighten it out, they did nothing to compensate us for all our lost time, frustration and hassle."
95,"- 1 ply toilet paper
-  view of the car park
- staff wasn't friendly at Check in or Check out 
- mini bar was so packed that we couldn't fridge our own waters; if we had removed the bottles in the fridge we would've been charged (electronic minibar)
- expected more luxury as advertised online 
- all the pools were shut even though it was 30C
- no complimentary coffee/tea with kettle as usual in most hotel rooms
- 7$ delivery fee, min. order and resort fee on top of room service
-150$ resort fee that was supposed to be included ended up not working at one of the advertised restaurants"
96,It says rate includes BREAKFAST which is actually a con. What it should say is - small take away bag of pastries and coffee. A proper cooked breakfast will cost you a minimum of another $50. This is very poor and people should be warned !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
97,Good and beverages are very expensive.
98,"Long way form the parking lot to the lobby, and back to the room."
99,"No buffet breakfast
Complimentary water in the room would really help. Also electric kettle as our kids were not well and wanted hot water to drink."
100,Because we arrived at 12 and check in not til 3pm they charged an extra $45 PER NIGHT for the early check in. Thought it was an upgrade but room was exactly the same as other suits.
101,Booked a high room with a king sized bed. Got a middle floor with 2 queen sized beds as all available king sized rooms were on smoking floors.
102,Absolutely nothing
103,I was not told that during check-in I need to deposit $100 cash. Also I don't know why they don't use my card details on booking.com. So I had to pay $479 during check-in.
104,Window view. I was told it was strip view.. it was not ! I hated seeing TRUMP HOTEL!
105,"i asked front desk for kettle,a staff said she would send someone bring it to my room. I'd been waiting for whole day,they still didn't come！！and next day i asked another staff about that, they said they didn't have the record of my order!! what's wrong with your staff!! If the staff doesn't want to help me, she can send another staff to help me.DO NOT LIED TO YOUR CUSTOMER！！"
106,Nothing
107,"No big complaints. It's a large building so a little confusing sometimes on which way to go, but there are signs everywhere to help guide you."
108,"1. There is no tea or coffee making facilities forcing you to get dressed and go buy it which is very poor for five star one would expect an espresso machine in the room for the price
2. The mini bar did not allow you to move items to store your own
3. The actual bath was quite small but two people can squeeze into it
4. The buildings are too tall which creates shaded pools and difficulty to sit in the sunshine"
109,Very long corridors and the view rooms don't have much of a view. Spend your money somewhere else. This place acts like they do you a favor by letting you stay there. Look at the bottom sections of the doors as you trek one of those long hallways.
110,The lower flours smelt like sewer so our first room on the 8th floor stank and we had to move at 2am to another room on the 24th floor.
111,"The 1st suite I walked into the room and it was filthy and I walked into coffee and pashio shells all over the place so we had to move to a different room, then we got food poisoning the next morning from the in house cook from the sausage.I missed half of the Michael Jackson One Show because of my diahrea and going to the bathroom so much and they wouldn't even compensate us for the show. Just $150 towards the room and took the whole weekend off. But it was my boyfriends 50th birthday and I called ahead to set up 50 black and silver balloons and then 1 50 marlar balloon. They couldn't even get that right never signed my name to the card nor did he get the 50 marlar balloon. I was crying by then and so was he the whole weekend was ruined. We were treated like King and Queen at the Mandalay Bay and will go there next time. The only person that saved the weekend was Monique and Johnathan."
112,"The room was dirty ( we had hairs in our shower and there was dust everywhere) The staff was not welcoming and not helpful and we had to wait long periods of time : it took us almost 2 hours to check in, we waited half an hour on the phone before we reached the front desk...
Not what you expect from a 5 star hotel..."
113,Check in receptionist offered upgrade which was completely unnecessary for a couple. Problem quickly rectified to our satisfaction through central bookings in hotel.
114,"The air-conditioning was bad in another word the room was not cool enough at night.
And i got to mention the cleanness of the room was not good we checked in with an empty bottle on the floor adding the housekeeping afterward was not as a 5 star hotel would be."
115,"I didn’t like that Booking.com charged $30 more than the actual Resort. Do not book with Booking.com without going to the Resorts website first. Had I booked with the Resort, not only would I have saved $30, but there was also a $150 Resort credit I missed out on for not booking directly."
116,"the walk to 2 sets of elevators was poor, No coffee or water in the room for $39 resort rate n my $200 / night. the pool was stupid no sun small , the food was very expensive i mostly had to eat at wintergreens. sportsbook football odds were too high."
117, Swimming pool is average. Pricing is steep especially after adding resort fees and taxes. Refundable deposit of  about usd 50 per day.
118,"Bathroom light fixtures although beautiful were bright enough, nor were there enough of them.   On closer inspection there could be a more thorough cleaning.  The  curtains surrounding the back  around the bed had layers of dust in between the folds.  As well there was dust on the top of the headboard.  Also a little bit of mold in the stand up shower."
119,There really wasn’t much to choose from to eat after a certain time inside the hotel.
120,The view overlooked the back of the hotel which looked as though it was the top of the garage; the phones did not work until maintenance was informed; found an empty water bottle on check in
121,"Charged 50 USD extra per day for a view, got a narrow stripe of nothing in particular = robbery at broad daylight! Hotel layout a nightmare, only bright side of constantly getting lost is getting lots of exercise!"
122,"A knock on the door for a room check at 8.30 am
If a long night before it’s too early to be woken up."
123,"The WiFi was very poor, speed was ridiculously slow considering it is 2017! A smartphone with a LTE connection would be faster. You could upgrade to 5Mbps!! This is still woefully slow!"
124,"Slow housekeeping. My son got sick from eating bad pizza from the food court and threw up the whole night. Had to call housekeeping a few times to get somebody to clean the room. Even then, housekeepers did a haphazard job at cleaning the puke, changing sheets. We fell asleep waiting, and they knocked past midnight to bring in extra linens we had requested a while back! The following day, they didn’t come until the Afernoon to take care of our puke-ridden room. So overnight we slept in puky sheets and dealt with puky smell. Well onto the next day."
125,"Casino very smoky. Not used to this in Europe any more. Don't even lift anything off the mini bar, you may be charged."
126,"Breakfast was TERRIBLE! What a ripoff to pay extra through your booking site, Booking.com, for pastries and fruit. That was enough to make me book directly through hotels in the future instead of your site. The hotel staff told me they have had several complaints about your “Grab and Go” breakfast. We didn’t even pick them up but we were charged for them, and the hotel can’t reverse the charges or change the order. There is no way to address the problem with Booking.com."
127,I did not like that the lack of a coffee maker in the room....having to go downstairs to buy coffee or pay about $30 for a pot to be brought up.  The fridge had no room for our food because it was sensor pricing all the space with hotel priced beverages.
128,"Too much rush at the Check-in counters but the staff were very efficient. Huge hotel, so lots of walking from the main entrance to the room(s) via two lifts."
129,"When you advertise ""including Breakfast"" it is NOT acceptable to get a voucher for a pick up breakfast (2 cups of coffee, 3 pieces of pastry) for 2 persons when we have booked for 4. This is a lousy excuse for a breakfast! Very Poor service and information from Booking.com"
130,"Breakfast was part of the room rate. Was disappointed to know, the included breakfast was a take away breakfast box with some pastries and few pieces of fruits. 
There was no kettle or tea bags or coffee in the room."
131,"My sister got bed bug bites on her neck and shoulder. 
She contacted the hotel on Oct 10 and has not heard from them at all regarding this. 
Also, we arrived to our room  one night at midnight and our room was not serviced. We had to call for towels. The beds were not made. I will report this to the vagas health dept."
132,"Not much, but never got breakfast. Really annoying and sneaky 'Resort fee' of U$40+ per day was added to bill on checkout. It's a really cheap trick that does the hotel no credit. But for the hotel it does the job of making the room rate look more affordable. Supposedly pays for extras like Wifi etc, although these are advertised as 'Free'. Not sure if this 'fee' would be considered legal anywhere but Vegas. Unwary travellers on a tight budget be aware you are going to be hit with this additional bill as well as local taxes. One of the top hotels in Vegas - at a price that's acceptable but unfortunately one that's not always up front."
133,"Poor value for money. We booked a brakefast included offer, and what we got was a 15 min line every morning, just to get a box with 2 old pastries. All pool areas are smoking areas so if you dont like lungs cancer you should only be in your room, and the wifi works only in the room. We regret coming here. after visiting many 5 stars hotels all over the world, this one was extremely disappointing"
134,"We asked for quiet room, as we have 2 years old baby and we got connected room and in that other room were very noisy guests. There was also food smell from the restsurant through A/C.. After 1. night they changed us the room, but we got one near the elevators, which were also noisy throught these paper walls..
But the worst was breakfast. When we were booking our stay, there was written , we will have continental breakfast.. After booking we reciebed confirmation email, where was writyen, that breakfast will be Grab and go! The quality of such breakfast is very poor../3small pasteries and bit of fruit..you waiting in lane to get sime boxes and you have to leave no seating at all). After complaining they deducted a tax resort fee from the bill and we have to find breakfast on out own. You just dont expect this from 5* hotel eventually the receptionist said its only 4*."
135,There is nothing negative I can say about the Venetian
136,"There were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. First night they tried to charge us for lots of contents from mini bar, which we didn't even open. But they deducted this off our bill when we highlighted it."
137,"My room rate is over $300 per night with tax and resort fee. 
First night late check in around 10pm and they dont have the room type that I booked for. 
Second night went back to hotel after whole day trip, found that the room wasn't clean up at all. I called and asked for house keeping ASAP then still wait for more than an hour still have no one come. I eventually went down and request a room change! 
I live in LA and went to vegas quite often, but I don't think I will stay in venitien anymore."
138,"The check in was slow even at 11pm, no special congratulations for our 10 wedding anniversary, even told the checking staff directly, we got engaged at the Venetian 11 years ago, so coming back was special, will not be returning."
139,"Nothing spectacular but an electric plug next to the bedroom would be nice to charge cell phone. Otherwise, the best hotel on the Strip I've ever seen so far."
140,"We were very surprised that the janitors do not wash floors and vacuum the floors!  I had to crawl under the bed to pick up a dropped item, where I found some items of the previous tenants and some much dust..."
141,"Staff very unhelpful and rude, breakfast £250 and not actually included just take away coffee and danish that cannot be eaten inside the hotel!!!!"
142,"I didn't enjoy the room to the fullest, I was out all the time"
143,"Under a medical emergency it took to long for someone to get there on the casino floor. A guest was unresponsive, it appeared lack of on site first responders,  AED not provided. Employed apeEd confused and none assisting  
Within first hour, Power in room went out &  toilet broke ( repair response was fast)"
144,"The room was advertised as offering free breakfast with the stay. The ""breakfast"" consisted of a cardboard box containing three small pure sugar pastries and a tiny pot of fresh fruit. You were also given a cup of weak filter coffee. The real joy was that you were not even given anywhere to sit and consider how pitiful it was - the restaurant handling the promo where you picked it up reserving it's empty seats for more important guests. On a room costing 650 usd after taxes this was disgraceful. The staff at the Venetian politely explained that they received regular complaints about this promo - and occasionally they considered passing the complaints on, but basically it wasn't their problem. As a paying customer who booked through an agent they weren't interested in whether you enjoyed your stay. And they were not receptive to my suggestion of explaining to guests that the breakfast deal would be disappointing - And that the guest should make alternative plans. They were extremely courteous- but really couldn't have cared less."
145,The breakfast provided was almost all carbs and as I don't eat them was useless. Only ate small carton of fruit. I asked if they could offer an alternative but they said it was arranged between booking.com and the cafe so NO.
146,"Upon entering the room we were greeted with a floor that had recently (same day) been washed. Although I appreciate they wash it, the carpet to the room we were given was still completely wet and the furniture was on the beds, their was a large noisy fan with a long extension cord connected to try and dry it. When we reported this they offered to come take fan out, which wouldn't of helped, the fan was needed to try and dry the carpet, but they did not offer or even allow us to switch rooms. We had to stay in a room with a wet carpet, unbelievable. Also, they gave us a room credit when we booked (this wasn't given to us because of the wet carpet, it was a booking promo offer), then at check out they were not honoring it. It became a big hassle (almost an hour to check out, straightening the issue). Fortunately that part was resolved. But over all our hotel was not what we had expected for the quality of hotel we thought we were getting. Very disappointed with staff and their unwillingness to be more helpful or accommodating."
147,No coffee/ tea making facilities in the room. Fridge full of minibar so can't be used for your own drinks.
148,"The problem was not with the property, but with Booking.com. The ""included breakfast"" is a joke. It is not through the hotel, but a 3rd party vendor. It is NOT room service, but a lunch counter where you can ""grab and go."" NOT worth the extra money. Annoyed that booking.com was misleading. Could have gotten the same rate on the hotel website with room service options. Live and learn."
149,nothing
150,"the breakfast -
i ordered and paid for a room with ""breakfast included"". when i asked about the the breakfast i got vague answers and only after morning arrived i understood why. 
i was a expecting the usual breakfast buffet or at an omlette but instead
people that have breakfast included wait in a very unclear, unorganized  seperate line at the grand lux cafe to find out they get a very cheap cheap ""to go"" bag with 2-3 pastries and some coffee. not even a place a place to sit just ""take your pitty breakfast bag and get out of here"".
if you want the morning buffet its 20$ per person (excl tax) .
even the person they put in charge of providing these pastry bag fwlt uncomfortable and kept saying sorry to all the shocked hotel visitors that had the breakfast voucher.
it is a very unexpected humilating, even insulting, joke from such a high end hotel.
so If you decide to go with the venitian, order a suite Without breakfast included and get it somewhere else"
151,Everything is charged. Even a kettle has delivery charge to be sent to your room. And we were welcomed with hair in the bathroom.
152,"Customer service at the front desk 
I booked this trip for a birthday and anniversary 
At the beginning in the check in we didn't got the room I ordered 
Asked for a non smoking high flor with view 
And got a smoking whit no view and not in high level 
We where tired and went to the room
It was almost 12:00 at night 
We couldn't fall a sleep it smelled very bed 
Even the bed sheets where sticky from cigarettes I don't think they where replaced!!!
In a  while 
 We went the next morning to the desk to ask for a different room he took them the whole day to give us a room then eventually turn out not so good well yes they gave us non-smoking high-level but the bathroom was dirty and full l
With  hairs 
 Again the next morning we went to the desk and they replaced the room to non-smoking but low level  
Until we reach the room the key wasn't working we waited 25 minutes for nobody to show so we went back to the desk to get a key I want to ask a question is this a joke or what
They only compensated us by canceling the  resort fees and gave us another hundred dollar to use At the hotel 
I think that it's a disgrace and we should not be charged at all hope that someone will hear about it it was my wife's 40 years old birthday very disappointing"
153,"huge hotel , takes time to get use to it
every thing cost money..parking , coffee etc
no coffee machine in the room
our room door was broken and took a while to fix it and in the mean time our children were stuck outside for a while  , we didn't get any apologize from the hotel"
154,Nothing really. The two minor problems were sorted. The mini bar is hugely expensive rendering it pointless. If you want breakfast in bed then sell your house...
155,"No tea / coffee in room.
The complex can bery disorientating due to its size and confusing layout. There are over 4,000 rooms on this hotel."
156,"We hadn't appreciated how pricey everything was going to be! The room was lovely, but didn't have the 'wow' factor that we thought we were going to have given the price we paid. Every ATM wants to charge $8 for withdrawals (which we were relying on given our prepaid card) and we soon found that everywhere was pretty pricey for food, drinks etc."
157,"It took hours to receive our luggage. The sofffa bed had dirty sheets. They tried to compensate us, but when you come for one night it really ruined the experience. The person that finally brought our luggage was very helpful."
158,Our upgrade to a strip view room was only a part view. Spa was way too overpriced.
159,"No drink making facilities in the suite and no complimentary water, which for the price was poor we thought."
160,Needed more umbrellas on the 3rd floor pool area.
161,"Majority of the Casino staff.
Unwillingness to be polite to younger guests."
162,"room keys never worked on the first time (I had 3), could be stood a few minutes outside my room, keep trying the key."
163,It's impossible to reach someone from the front desk via phone. I was waiting on line for more than 30 min and hung up.
164,We didn't realise smoking was allowed inside in the gambling areas.  No matter how good the AC is it still drifts into non smoking areas.
165,"Expensive for food and water in hotel, lots of extra fees, constant people shouting at you about timeshares - shouldn't be in a hotel it made it very frustrating(screaming down a hallway at you)"
166,Nothing
167,As always never enough sunbeds by the pool.
168,"The hotel is just a massive money making machine, no kettle or coffee making facilities in the room, no usable fridge in the room but a fridge could be hired for 25 dollers a day and tea or coffee could be ordered up to the room for a cost plus 7 dollers delivery charge!
Upon arrival the first thing we was asked was would we like to upgrade the room at an extra cost, which when you have paid a lot of money already for your room puts a downer on things before you have even seen the room."
169,"very expensive rate (daily average  500$) without BF.
paid for resort fee (30$ daily - most of Vegas hotels have resort fee)
valet parking long Que - 15 to 20 minutes to get your car."
170,"For the price I expected more. There was nothing included in the hotel price, not even a comp for the casino. And the decor was clearly a few decades old. The hotel is enormous and got quite loud at night, and we got lost several times."
171,No coffee or tea facilities in the room.
172,"Only one downfall.  This cannot be a statement just for the Venetian, but coming from a smoke free country, it is a let down to see that smoking is allowed throughout the whole hotel."
173,Not very friendly!  Not the cleanest hotel !  Way overrated !  And if you like  breathing smoke no matter where you're at that's the place to go !  Sure don't feel very safe even in your own hotel !
174,"The bar and refrigerator are on a weight system. DO NOT TAKE ANYTHING OFF OF YOU WILL BE CHARGED. Unless you want to pay $10 for a handful of Mixed Nuts. If you want a larger ice bucket for your room, they charge you for a larger ice bucket."
175,"Bed was used/messed up when we arrived, that really spoiled the ""wow""-effect, I had hoped for, when upgrading to a room at 36th floor with a strip-view.
Also the pool area was closed because it rained => very disappointed kids.
Everything is extremely expensive, at the resort (e.g. 11$ for a cup of coffee from the local cafe)"
176,"On 3/4/27, We called security office when our car battery died. Security on phone said they're battery charger was not working and couldn't assist us. My husband was calling roadside assistance, when 2 bike security men rode up on and offered us assistance.  One security went to get a battery charger and helped us boost our car battery. These two security guards riding their bikes came to our aid while the security on the phone didn't do anything to help us."
177,"No coffee pot in room????? what's up with that?
called room service in morning for coffee and 45 minute wait..had to get dressed and go down to coffee bean.
will def bring my own coffee pot next visit.
this is the first hotel i'v stayed at with the coffee issue.
very disappointed"
178,Coffee making machine in the room would be perfect
179,"Expensive, even charged for a bottle of water in the room. Stayed at the MGM and Bellagio, neither charge for water. Wouldn't stay at the Venetian again!"
180,The players club staff were the only downfall to the Venetian.
181,"Rooms smelt of smoke, staff were unfriendly, very few complimentary items in the room i.e. no kettle or coffee.  Felt very sparse for 5* hotel."
182,"Everything was perfect. We had some noisy neighbors and the moved us to another suite, so there was no problem at all."
183,The prices for the wet bar in the room! I think those prices were outrageous.
184,"We found the weight-sensitive charging of items from the minibar (used or not) quite distasteful and we were too scared to go anywhere near it. Directions from the lobby to the lifts were not clear. After flying from London and checking in at 1:30am, housekeeping woke us up by entering our room at 9:00am."
185,"No coffee maker in the room, and most hotels have free bottle of water every day. Not much staff walking around if you have questions, so you have to go to check in area to find personnel.  Casino staff had no idea where things were"
186,Hated the shower - awful water pressure and shower heads - NO vent fan in toilet room ( this is just gross ) linens we not enough .. I think they leave limited so you need to call for more and would have to tip more often .. It is all set up for you to pay more and more ..
187,Generally expensive but it was New Year's Eve. Had to complain about the worn out room in the Venetian Tower before they moved us to the Pallazzo Tower. Long queues during check-in.
188,"Room service took  2.5 hours on a Thursday morning for 2 meals.
Ordered only drinks on Friday morning took over an hour to deliver a glass of oj and coffee.
Had our driver take us cracker barrel @ 8 miles away and had the meal and returned in the same amount of time.
We come to LV @ once a month and stay a quite a few different properties.
Venetian was a top choice...
We will never stay here again."
189,"The resort fee is annoying because you don't expect it, why not just tell us the full price, or charge for additional amenities; we didn't use the pool etc why pay for it? It's irrelevant but also disappointing that Sheldon Adelson owns these hotels and as such right wing hate is supported by the hotel, but he owns pretty much half the strip so kind of hard to avoid him!
It gets crowded at times because the hotel is such a sight to see."
190,"Charged me twice for my stay ($4,000) causing my bank account to be frozen for over a week. Denied having done so. Completely destroyed any good things I'd have had to say. Outrageous behaviour."
191,"Had to walk a quarter of a mile from front desk to room each time, fridge was packed with hotel items could not use it for yourself, absolutely no view as a A/C unit was outside the window."
192,The purchase of postage stamps was so difficult that I went to Walgreens to purchase them.  The front desk should be able to supply this service and know how much it costs to mail a postcard to another country.
193,"(1) No baby crib available
I contacted The Venetian through Booking.com where I booked my rooms, and tried to reserve a baby crib for my 8-month daughter about 15 days before we arrive at The Venetian. However, I was told that reservation is not available.
When we checked-in on Dec. 24 , no crib is available. In the 2nd day's morning (Dec. 25), I visited Front-Desk, and tried to reserve a baby crib again. The Front-Desk called related department, and put my name in the waiting list. However, the crib is still unavailable after we checked out. 
 
(2) No free drink water provided in the room
I stayed several hotels, and most of them will provide free 2 bottles of dink water every day. It doesn't cost too much, but let the customer feel better. Furthermore, there is no vending machine in the passage.
 
(3) My room is assigned to other guests before my check-out !!!
I contacted Front-desk twice (Dec. 26 night and Dec. 27 morning), and requested extended check-out at 2:00pm, because my flight is at 4:55pm. The lady at front-desk told me that both of my rooms have been extended to 2:00pm without any additional charge. However, when I went back my rooms at 1:15pm Dec. 27, one of rooms was already occupied by other guests !! My door card became invalid. You know, I didn't checked out my rooms at that time. How could you assign my rooms to other guests? There might be my personal stuffs inside the room! I am very disappointed!  I am not sure whether I missed any thing, since I didn't count every detail in my baggage.
Overall, my stay at The Venetian is quite unsatisfactory."
194,"I will never book through booking.com, it was a nightmare , I had to pay $35 extra each night because I requested one king  room and a one queen room. Booking .com failed to change the reservation, I had to change to the palazzo hotel because the Venetian doesn't have queen rooms, it was my twin sister and my birthday and we planned this trip in august 2016 and the result was we ended in separate hotels."
195,"Tea facilities could be offered without additional charge- kettle only on offer no tea or coffee with it. No slippers in the room (not like last time I stayed here) 
Our property was taken out of the room without our consent and I had an ordeal to get some satisfaction. Still no word from the hotel on what happened to our property. I would say that it was probably a once off occurrence but surprised they did not do more for us."
196,Nothing included in room cost. It was expensive so a breakfast or something would have been a nice touch.
197,"They charge you additional 35 dollars for wi fi service, which I believe should be free in grand hotel like this one."
198,"- Staff was absolutely rude and ungracious. 
- No water in the room...each bottle would be charged @$20 including delivery charge to the room.
- Spoon for medicine to be charged @$7 plus tax...we ordered a desert instead.
- Room was not cleaned properly for 2 days out of 3. We actually complained to the Housekeeping but still no one came to help. Requested access to house keeing manager, which went unheard. 
Overall nothing positive to write about.
Instead we spent the next 3 nights at Encore Wynn and had an absolute amazing time...Highly recommend all travellers to check Wynn Encore as it is the right property for luxury travellers at similar pricing but amazing value for money."
199,"Front desk/reception was often very busy, but such is the case with most hotels in Vegas."
200,The fridge was a vending machine so no mini fridge to cool some drinks.
201,"Nothing, other than the systems being down which isn't anyone's fault"
202,The front desk staff didn't look like they were having a very good day and the lady that was helping me talked to me as if she didn't really care and just wanted to give me the room quickly and moved onto the next person.
203,It could have been a lot more modern. It looks late 80's done up a little. You can see by the wear and tear in areas in the room. Also walking through a complete smoking floor of a casino to get to your room elevator isn't the best experience with kids. Needs to be a separate area for this.
204,"Weak water pressure, didn't feel like a 5 star hotel. The beds were worn down and in need of change. They don't even provide slippers or water. Their robes were worn down and felt like rags. They charge $6 for a bottle of water. The wifi is really slow and to put it nice and short; not worth the price of the room."
205,"The place is so big, so it was difficult and sometimes takes a long time to get from one place to another."
206,"The staff were very rude, unprofessional and unwelcoming. 
There was no coffee provided in the room."
207,The ventilation in the casino. It was really smokey but never did it effect our room or stay.
208,"Always difficult to unlock the door from my room, even the keys have changed. And a front desk staff has said that she gonna send someone to check the lock of the door but nobody gonna come to check on it."
209,"Smoking in the casino, you have to smell the smoke when you pass to the elevators. Would be nice to have normal breakfast. 45 minutes waiting time for the luggage take out."
210,Originally we were in a room on the 27th floor but as we asked for a room with a view we paid an up charge of approx $150 to get a view of the Las Vegas strip but received a room on the 8th floor with No view at all.
211,"They charge extra for all, all the water in the room are $5.00 and up!, don't open the mini-bar they will charge only for opening the door"
212,"The hotel may have been affordable, but food & drinks can be quite expensive, Within the hotel, and on the strip! For example a small water bottle that was located in the rooms mini bar was $7..."
213,Expensive! The casino is pricey with huge table minimums and the restaurants are pricey too although some have great happy hours. Ended up with 35 dollars in bogus mini bar charges although they were removed on check out with no problems. Wifi was rubbish. Took a big reservation of money from my credit card and still waiting for the refund 6 days later!
214,"- For a luxury hotel, there no slippers, toothbrush and toothpaste provider
- Disconnect service between housekeeping & room service. We ordered food from the in-room dinning the night before however we were shocked to learned that the housekeeping didn't collect the plates when they cleaned up our room the following day. Upon calling, we were told to call room service instead. We called room services however no one came. The plates were left in our room for 2 days before they were collected =("
215,Pls read above.
216,"There wasn't a kettle in my room for tea or coffee. I had to order a carafe for $16.00, plus extra fees totaling to $30 for a carafe of coffee. The coffee itself was terrible. It was bitter and not even luke warm."
217,A bit far from the things/places that I was doing in the strip.. But it was only for my experience. Easy to get taxi or uber anyway.
218,No tea or coffee in the room.
219,Nothing made me uncomfortable or sad everything was perfect for me
220,At check in the front desk agent was a little snobby. I wish I had a warm welcoming since it was my first time at the hotel. She seemed to be doing the bare minimum when checking me in and I know I was early when checking into my room but when I asked if I could get something a bit higher she got frustrated with me saying that it was still early and I would have to wait and she wasn't able to give me a time. I know the process of checking someone in and I don't blame her answers but the attitude could have been skipped.
221,A later check out is always a plus.
222,The system was down due to an upgrade and they couldn't let us get the room right away on check in time. Later they gave us a room and then told us they need to move us to another room which was different to what we asked for which then they needed to move us to a third room but it was already 11 pm and wanted to sleep so we slept in the second room. It was a big mess!!
223,Took 7 hours to get my room and they tried to give me a 100 food voucher to be used in the hotel... wow.. then got to my room finally and found out it was the wrong room.. the pricing in the hotel was crazy... spent 70 for a breakfast and they charge you almost 4.00 for a pop..
224,Not being able to store even a bottle of water in the fridge supplied as it was completely full of stocked items.
225,"The wifi signal was very poor in our room, it would only work if you were sitting right at the desk in the corner. We contacted the hotels IT department and the problem still persisted. In the end I gave up trying to connect. There was also no bar fridge to put any items. The items in the small fridge was stocked full of mini bar item (which if you lifted or moved anything would be charged to your bill). I also didn't appreciate the strong cigarette smell in the halls. I understand that it's a casino and people smoke in the lobby etc but the smell lingered in the hall outside our door. Wasn't plesent to smell all the time. I also thought to gondola ride looked amazing but I feel like hotel guests shouldn't have to pay the full price , or at least a discount for hotel guests."
226,The room service was very pricey- especially with delivery fees on top.
227,"With all the awesome things they had to offer, they were some downers as well. First, my husband opted to receive the 15 dollars of ""table "" credit instead of ""slot"" credit. However, the tables wouldn't accept the credit so we were left with essentially a souvenir check. 
Also, some of the staff are just down right rude. Although we stayed for 4 days, we only ate breakfast there only once. The breakfast staff were just ridiculously rude. 
Not to mention I absolutely hated having to go downstairs because, as soon as you step off of the elevator you are attacked by the smell of smoke."
228,The only thing I had an issue with was having to walk through the smokey casino floor with my children to get to the rooms
229,"Terrible services:
a) long check-in line and rude / unfriendly staff. Booked into the Venetian, but got Palazzo (sister property attached to the Venetian)... no idea why?
b) SHOCKING house keeping - not enough amenities (e.g. towels, shampoo, etc) provided for the number of people booked and paid for in the room. One day our room wasn't even cleaned - had to be requested a number of times and was only cleaned at 8pm that evening. Any requests took c.2 hours to be actioned. No turndown services - for a high * hotel, very unexpected!
c)Terrible concierge service - rude, unfriendly, not interested staff, only happy to sell their own 'approved' services. 
d) Absolutely no help with luggage on check in or check out - prepare to drag your luggage yourself to your rooms through carpeted casino floors!!!
Very disappointed stay will not return."
230,"The hotel is beautiful.  However, it didn't feel clean.  The non-smoking room had the fragrance of cigarette smoke.  The room was dark and had a not so fresh odor to it.  We normally putts on the day of check out to enjoy our stay; this time, we were up at 6AM and out by 8AM."
231,Wish they had a fridge to store our own personal drinks and food.
232,"There is a charge of 25 dollars a day to ""rent"" a fridge. The one included in the room is packed full of purchasable items with no room left for your own food or drinks. The amenities of the room were extremely lacking for the price that we payed to stay. No hair dryer, no coffee maker, no extra towels;only two full sized ones left for us! It was a beautiful room but lacked in the comforts that even cheap hotels our iced for no extra cost. Very disappointed in that aspect"
233,"The shower jet power was really poor. 
There is nothing to do there but the casino and the mall. So boring and limited 
You end up being charged away more that what you agreed to pay upon check in. 
Overall poor value for money"
234,I booked on the Venetian but the room was at the Palazzo Hotel maybe they are the same but they should mention this at the booking because at the website they are separate.
235,Cigarette smoke thru casino!
236,We are older and did not like the difficult  maze and distance we had to navigate to find our room. I also did not like the heavy quilt on the bed. I sweat all night. Thought I had the air set cold enough. I need a lighter blanket
237,"Cleaning of our suite wasn't thorough, and dirty drinking glasses were not replaced during a whole week."
238,"I didn't like that I checked into venetian hotel but yet they put me into palazzo which I had walk across whole property to get to my suite.And that's not all I valet park my car when I checked in, so when I was checking out I was fine to check out at palazzo but yet again I had walk across property to get my car from venetian valet staff, which I was not advised from registration staff when I arrived or when I checked out."
239,Very noisy by our room. Stayed at a different hotel on the strip and it was closer to the airport but the room was alot quieter.
240,"There was a large blood stain under our pillow, which we didn't notice until the morning after since we didn't get into bed until very late the previous night. It left us feeling grossed out. We were offered a room change but since we booked our stay next to our family, we didn't want to relocate."
241,"everything is with fees even water and hot water ,kettle etc. it doesn't sound good with this luxury designed hotel. in gulf area where I live we used to luxury service although paid indirectly but give nice impression water free , kettle ....."
242,"what I don't like of this super expensive hotels is that you don't have free wifi or coffee or water in the room!! In cheap motels you always have those services, I don't understand why they don't offer this in the expensive ones, that should be basic"
243,"Heated pool, hot tub, jacuzzi would've been great. A refrigerator to hold our left overs and drinks would've been nice without an extra charge."
244,The room had hard water spots and stains on the counter tops.  The TV kept losing signal and freezing up.  The toilet and sink kept running and had a smell coming from the water.  It took 4 hours to get a package delivered from the internal package room AND 3 hours to get dishes cleared from room service.  Carpet was shabby in the room I was in
245,"I kind of wished the shower had a closed door/curtain, but it wasn't a huge deal. Also   a mini fridge and microwave would have been nice."
246,"As a Brit, I missed having tea and coffee making facilities and would have loved to have had breakfast included."
247,The fact that the rooms didn't have coffee making facilities.
248,A shame not to have breakfast/ water/ any food or drink included
249,"No morning paper outside doior,  shower didn't have good water pressure,communication was not always forthcoming,"
250,Our view was a little boring. Having a pay minibar in such a place seems a bit silly. The prices were prohibitive.
251,There's nothing to dislike about the hotel.
252,"Looking old and the towel in toilet are dirty and the value of money 40% more than showing in Booking.com 
The hotel will till you to pay 40% more in check in!!!!!!!!"
253,I did not like having to cut through the smoky casino to check in and check out. I also missed a coffee maker.
254,"Casino felt taken advantage of, as someone who had not played black jack before."
255,Unfortunately when we checked into the Venetian they didn't have a non smoking room available therefore they put us up in the Palazzo. The Palazzo is also fantastic but we did book to stay at the Venetian.
256,Vegas in general is getting very pricey.
257,"the bar in the casino was dirty and messy ;the video poker machines buttons were sticky, needed cleaning up"
258,"Housekeeping could have been much better. The shampoos, soaps, bathrobes and glasses were not replenished. The Wifi was good in casino, however it was PATHETIC in the room."
259,"The beds were too high to climb into without a stool. We were given a room at the far end of the hallway and told it was halfway down the hall, (which it wasn't) so it  meant we had to walk the furthest to and from the elevators, even though we both use walkers. This made it difficult to go anywhere and we got tired before we even got started. It would have been nice to have seen a floor map when checking in to help find the ice machine and see where our room would be before we accepted it and went all that way."
260,The rooms do not have tea / coffee making facilities. Only plastic cutlery available in the food court.
261,"The service of the staff was terrible, they wanted a lot of money for everything and werr really sarcaatic and non caring.. for examply they dont provide a toothbrush and if u want one simple one they only offer a crappy kit for 32 dollars.. worst hotel iv'e ever been in vegas.. me and my friend checked out after one day and decided to go to the aria"
262,"After having stayed in the Aria for a similar amount of money, we couldn't have been more disappointed. The reception area is loud and overcrowded with nowhere to sit if the queue is long, or if you're in a big party and some want to wait at the chairs. I was feeling very ill when we arrived, and there was nowhere for me to wait while my boyfriend checked in. The design of the place actually feels kinda oppressive, low ceiling, lots of smoke, and too many people made it feel like an overcrowded zoo."
263,The casino was not clean and air filtration was not sufficient. Ash trays were left dirty and I found in several locations. The door key pad to room had to be fixed in the middle of the night.
264,"Personel in reception are not friendly,gave me very far room from the left inspite I am 60 years old, no meal plan, although the room is expensive no kettle, when I asked for one they charge me for it??, on checkin they took 100$in cash and gave me receipt to take it back on checkout,but they did not give me the money as promised and told me they will return it to my credit card"
265,Was fully booked when I needed it:)
266,must of the stuff are not nice. the minibar is full so you dont have any place to put anything refrigerated
267,"Although we paid with 3 months in advance using booking, the room was not confirmed, and we have problems at checking, not having the exact room we had requested. At the end they ""found"" one."
268,"Not the best and kindest staff, no sun in the swimming pool areas, rooms far away from the elevators, dealers with no smile on their face. I will certainly not come back again."
269,I cannot think of anything I didn't like about the place besides the check in issue
270,"1. The bedsheets had a foul odor, and the corridors had a horrible stench
2. Everything took over 40 mins to come ( water, in room slippers, luggage, bell boy , food, and even tissues.) 
3. We changed rooms after the first night and we had to wait over 2 hours just to get our keys and everytime we called reception they said it was on the way to us. 
4. We were charged for everything and anything , and though i dont mind paying, in return i would have liked to see the amount of money going into the hotel being reciprocated through the service and quality like any 5 star hotel.
5. We have been to numerous 5 star hotels , this was by far, the worst experience . We were not treated like how a 5 star hotel should treat it's hotel guests.
6. This is the most commercial and profit based hotel i have been to , the quality and service was the lowest i've ever experienced.
(Bear in mind we stayed in a deluxe suite and we are IHG elite members and we were treated as if we were in some 3 star hotel) 
* we are newlyweds and since we are IHG elite members they upgraded us to another room which was exactly the same size and it was a DOUBLE bed room ???"
271,there was still hairs of the previous customer in the bathtub.  Internet going up and down
272,"First off, I booked online and the price shown on website was totally different when checking in. I would recommend to just include all tax and resort fee so customers are aware of what to expect. Its shocking really, especially if the price difference is a large amount."
273,It's a pretty big property and I managed to get lost a few times.
274,"Hotel information lacked in the hotel room e.g. No clear literature on the services available E.g. Pool times, shopping, dining, entertainment, bars, gaming etc. Not even when & where. The experience was more biased towards self discovery on that front."
275,there is nothing included at the price. as a guest of the hotel - you do not get any privileges - no breakfast etc.  the pool was too small
276,"It was a lot of trouble checking in and finding a place suitable for a group with a 1 yr old baby. After two trips to reception and a phone call...p.s two trips in a very large hotel meant 1 hr process with a 1yr old baby...... checking in seeing the rooms and finding out they were initially very very far from eachother, calling reception, heading back down, talking to someone nice enough to give us two adjoining rooms, moving our stuff again. 
Casino - smoking...but I guess this is allowed in Las Vegas.... We managed to find routes around the smoke.
We mainly stayed here to be close to the canyon and to be comfy. Worth it, but the hotel is so huge, having a problem at check in makes it a large mess. So make sure to spend the extra time down there, and cross your fingers you have a nice staff member so they can accommodate a travelling family with a 1yr old."
277,Nothing.  I enjoyed everything.
278,I disliked the long walk to the elevators to get to your rooms......it didn't matter which way you enter. I also dislike having to walk through smokey areas which is very popular in Vegas
279,The rooms for me were a disappointment. They were not of 5 star quality and there wasn't even water or a tea/coffee maker which is standard in most hotels in America. You had to pay a resort fee to use the facilities and the restaurant and bar prices were so high. It felt like you had to pay for an extras that in a 5 star hotel should have been included. The pool chairs were filthy as well.
280,"The resort is so large that it took us 10+ minutes to get from our hotel room, down two sets of elevators and across breezeways, etc to get to food court/restaurants/gym. It got old very fast. The staff is positioned at various stations along trek to point you in the right direction which we appreciated. I would definitely request a room closer to the hub of activity next time."
281,If you want a strip view you'll have to pay extra other than that nothing to complain about!
282,No coffee maker in the room . Close from another person left behind still there .  Sofa bed dirty with stuff on it .
283,"The most disgusting hotel room ever. 
The housekeeping service is really bad. 
Some of the things i was shocked to see in a 5 star hotel. ( i was served dinner in a broken tray! , the duvet was torn! And one of the days i left the room at 1pm and came back at 9pm and it wasn't clean.  Really the worst experience ever."
284,"Housekeeping left dirty dishes in the room. Didn't clean shower area. A housekeeping manager stopped by the room and told us that he would make it better "" for the next guests"" and walked away without taking the dirty dishes out of our hands!"
285,"- No simple things as kettles in the room
- Encountered an issue that required remote assistance by phone (after checkout), staff wasn't helpful on this case
- Pool seating options isn't big enough for this amount of visitors
- Irritating minibar that charge for everything you *moving* in the bar + doesn't allow to put your own bottle of water."
286,"The shower head was a trickle, terrible water pressure. The towels were threadbare. Just seems a bit tired and starting to need a refresh - especially considering the price. 
There are way better options these days than the Venetian - it used to be my favourite, but no more!"
287,"Mandatory resort fee added on top of room cost, even though we didn't use the facilities. By the time we added this, tax, and paid for breakfast which wasn't included the night cost over £200."
288,Trek from self parking to reception and another to the room.
289,"When we arrived , in our rental care we were sent around the world to park. Really stressful after a very long trip. Staff didn't seem to know where we should go.
Long check in queue. When I went down to the lobby an hour later there was still a long queue."
290,Cost and up-charge to check in 2 hours early when obviously rooms are available. And resort fee that I had no intention of using.
291,a five star hotel should have a coffee maker in the room. it is a loooong walk to get a cup of coffee in the morning.
292,The hotel is a bit aged and stinks like cigarettes!!!! They charge you for a kettle and don't provide complimentary tea and coffee in the room!!! They charge you if you knock something in the mini bar (as its weight sensitive) even if you don't use it!! Brutal!! You are definitely just a number at this huge hotel!! We also found the gambling here very expensive!!! There were no options to bet smaller amounts.
293,I would say the worst part was how difficult it is to figure out how to work around the hotel.  It took us 30 minutes and poor directions just to find the gondola ride. it was super frustrating.
294,We didn't find out until our last morning that we could have gotten discounts in at least the cafe express for being a hotel guest. Where else not sure. 1 casino employee was very rude. I say bring comfortable walking shoes. Our feet hurt the whole time. We walked too much with the wrong shoes; our fault 😏 When leaving the guys were very helpful at customer service at Palazzo but the airport shuttle never showed! That is the reason and the rude employee for the low score.
295,Time and effort required to get to and from the room using two elevators and six corridors. No usable fridge in the room. No coffee making facilities.
296,"The hotel is sooooo large, it is hard to find your room, restaurants, shops.
More signage would be appreciated."
297,"Smoking everywhere, but it is come with Las Vegas package. Did not have a coffee machine in the room. But on the positive side of it: it made us have coffee by the Venecian canal."
298,"Time it took to check in
Time it took to obtain a rewards card
Lack of a coffee machine in room
The resort free
Elevators were not all operating"
299,Casino waitresses could have been more friendly. The dealers were fine but the waitresses were often curt and dismissive.
300,There's no such a thing
301,"-towels did smelt like food or some other smell but were clean.
-rooms are lacking a hair dryer? couldnt find one.
-for this amount of guest there are not enough sunbeds. If you want to go to the pool-get there early. Not shaded sunbeds are in minimum. People save sunbeds with towels and will come back hours later."
302,"The Hike to our room.  Not only was it like going through a maze but being one who has health issues and a difficult time walking long distances we probably walked at least a good quarter of a mile if not more to get to our room.  I had requested a low floor and something close to an elevator or entrance so I wouldn't have to walk to far.  I hav wanted to stay at the Venetian for quite awhile but was disappointed that it was such trouble to get to our room.  Also, we were hoping to do a Gondola ride for our anniversary but the prices were outrageous.  Truly the only good thing about the stay was the staff"
303,"I'm not a Vegas person so...
Most irritating was their extre 35$ for the hotel facilities, even though we never used them. 
The total price with taxes was 200$!
The smokes of cigarettes was felt all the way up to the corridor 
You must go throw all the stupid machine to get to the elivator that will take you to your room"
304,"My stay at the Venetian Hotel was not much of a great one. I was upgrade room I paid $100 each day  Front desk staff said that room great street view but it was swimming pool view and wifi didn't work 
Also,  The sink in the bathroom did not close all the way. It kept leaking of water as well as the shower knobs. The constant running of water was of insanity. The water kept the floors of the bathroom moist like a swimming pool changing room. 
This was definitely not one of a satisfying stay.."
305,"Just wish they had firm foam pillows. We called housekeeping and thought they were bringing some to our room, but it was just two more feather pillows. That's the only complaint"
306,Prices in the stock mini bar an fridge!
307,"NO coffee pot in room. While, I understand there are coffee shops and room service, very cheap of them not to provide a convenience for their guests. NO free airport shuttle! What??? Another important amenity that was missing.  Even the Gondola ride had to be paid for!!!"
308,Really Expensive
309,"Hotel room should provide coffee maker or microwave. Fridge is full of hotel items, no space to store our own drink. Not suitable for family that need hot water or to store milk."
310,"Our room wasn't cleaned every day.
Wifi was terrible.
Costs such as spa costs were very expensive."
311,"The service is real bad, it took forever for the staff to bring one thing to the room, even though it was something basic which it should be in the room before the guest check in, such as flippers and toothbrushes. Very disappointed at the services and will never go back."
312,"Its just too big.. Staff is inconsistent.. Some sre great some are shockers.. We were told we had $150 room credt per for each of our two rooms on check in only to find out that it was only for one room, mean while we had already spent our credit for each room .."
313,Could have had a coffee machine in the room
314,The check-in queue was very long when we arrived. It appeared every day is like so. The front desk staff is lack of energy and doesn't seem to be patient.
315,only one thing could have been better. If I had more time to stay
316,"Valet was a bit rude to our son, as he apparently pulled into the wrong lane - he wanted us to drive completely around in ridiculous traffic and get into the correct lane. So from then on we self parked."
317,"I ordered eggs benedict Saturday morning. Shortly after I became ill and vomited. (I haven't drank alcohol in 8 years so it was attributed to anything to do with alcohol). I haven't vomited from food in 20 years, so it was directly related to the breakfast.
I was fine after about 30 mins. That meal, I would to like have compensated. But once again,  everything else was 5 STAR !!"
318,The noise in the restaurant during breakfast was far to loud.  I assume it was that to drown out the noise from the slot machines.
319,"Found a couple of business cards in the robe pocket, which suggests that the robes had been used by previous guest. Put them to wash immediatley but got new ones right away. Under the beds could be a little more cleaner..."
320,"the pool was a disappointment. We found it quite small and not so creative and fun.  They have quite a few pools, but they are all the same, only differ in size."
321,"The room is old and not well maintained, many power plugs are loose. No breakfast, drinking water, heater at this price. And it is very far away between parking, front deck and your room.
The canal view is not attractive to us in compare with the music fountain in Bellegio."
322,"long trek from anywhere to our suites, up to three elevators and hallway trips long enough to carry a lunch, the logistics of this place is very confusing. We had eleven people in our group and we all agreed never again. A beautiful place very impressed. The food was not impressive,and thats an understatement."
323,Service at the grand lux was poor also this is second year in a row that we have tried to order French toast to find that there is none available. Items on menu should be available.
324,Check in queue was long but well managed.  Signage for entrance and exit from the car park was non-existent.  I got completely lost trying to get back out on to the strip to drive back to the airport.
325,"The hotel is massive so takes ages to get in/out of the hotel or to places in the hotel it's self.
There was no coffee/tea making facilities (or complimentary water) in the rooms & as its so far away from cafes...
Needed a map of hotel as its difficult to find your way around"
326,"Restaurants were slightly pricey but it's the Venetian in Vegas, easy to find slightly less pricey places!"
327,"We paid for a view of the strip which i don't believe we got. The only hotel on the strip we could see was the Mirage over the road, hardly a strip view."
328,Nothing I have stayed in several hotels in Vegas but this hotel by far was the best and the cost was less then the service I received.
329,Smoke near or in casino. Lack of adequate staffing at concierge desk. long wait on phone. The pool closed to early at 10pm. It should of been open until midnight.
330,"IT guy tried to charge me $170 to make HDMI work, fixed it myself for free later.
Extremely large hotel with bad directions to some places in the hotel, easy to get lost."
331,"I stayed for three days no body come to clean my room
The smoking in the entrance
Although they said its non smoking hotel"
332,Service in the restaurants was slow.
333,It smells like tobacco in several places since you can smoke inside. A bit pricey in general but not as pricey as other hotels. TV check out didn't work.
334,"Everything is seriously overpriced as everywhere in Vegas and the smell of smoke hangs in the air. By now, you can get better service and amenities in any mid class Hotel in China..."
335,"Light in our room was on constantly as the switch to turn it off didn't work - very annoying when trying to sleep. The floor got soaked when using the shower as the door seal wasn't on all the way down. 
Didn't ruin our stay though and I would defiantly book it again."
336,"A little pricey, given that breakfast is not included. Also, when you pay on booking, be aware that they also charge you a service fee of around 30 $ per day, plus other tax."
337,"No real welcome on arrival, ignored by bell boys and check-in staff very robotic. Room service well overpriced and sub-standard for the strip. Quite smoky in casino, newer hotels much better air quality."
338,"No coffee facilities in the suite, sounds pathetic but when you pay nearly $300 and then have to go downstairs and pay another $8-10 for your morning coffee it a little annoying!!! Also there is a minibar but no separate fridge for keeping your drinks cool. Not big issues but for the price it's disappointing"
339,"Would have liked a Cleaner bedroom, very dusty, no coffee machine in room, 
Very busy lobby at all times"
340,Nothing. This place gets a 10/10
341,"The key to the room didn't work probably, remote control was broken and after the cleaning the tub was dirty"
342,"It looks very luxury as appearance, but I don't think it is reaching professionism as a hotel in term of service. We paid USD400 a night, only for the look not feel real from the heart."
343,Would have preferred a room with a view of the strip rather than the back of the hotel.
344,Beds aren't very comfortable. No activities like water volley ball going on in the pool areas. The hotel is smoker friendly which reminded me of being in an old snooker hall before the ban. Everything in the shops and restaurants is quite expensive so we went else where after a couple of nights.
345,"View from our room sucked! It was the top of the outside of the convention center. I think they should have offered us a better room, with a view. I think they put us on the hospitality floor which was much too noisy for my taste."
346,"Very disappointed, reported on night one that there was a strong smell of cannabis coming into our room from the corridor, was told it is totally unacceptable and security would deal with it..the problem just got worse, every hour the smell kept coming in to our room for the next 2 nights! 
Wifi was absolutely terrible, got the top tier package and was no improvement whatsoever. 
This hotel is stunning, but over priced for the experience. What do we pay our resort fees for??
Very little atmosphere for such a highly renowned hotel."
347,"Service and staff, very poor services. Second night in my wife lost her key and they wouldnt allow her in and they refuse to contact me, till i got there a few  hours later, no apolagies, she was mistreated, wont recommend this place to my worst enemy. Avoid this place."
348,nothing ...it's utterly beautiful !!!
349,Hotel had no atmosphere. Was very expensive to stay in and facilities weren't excellent and were overpriced to use (not all facilities included in room price). We were celebrating a special occasion which staff where aware of but no acknowledgement made
350,"The hotels water bottle in the rooms are not complementary they cost $5.
It would have been nice if they were complementary as you are paying so much money to stay in the hotel."
351,"On check in we upgraded to a suite with a view, BUT the room hadn't been cleaned--bed unmade, trash in the room, used towels thrown all over the bathroom. Not what we expected from this hotel."
352,Very expensive to eat or drink in (like all the hotels in Vegas). But there are 2 Walgreens on either side of the hotel where you can buy much cheaper alcohol and snacks!
353,"The showers are large but are not particularly powerful, it won't blow away those cobwebs or bad hangovers. Some of the room furniture is a little well worn and not all that comfy. Not a negative but the huge scale of the place makes everything (even things in the hotel) quite far away from your room."
354,"When we checked-in there was a room key and sunglasses on the table like somebody had been there. So staff came and collected those items. Everything was cleaned but it did make us a bit bummed. Also, Pringles was charged to our room when we didn't have any but we got that removed from our bill without problem. Wi-fi was slow."
355,No tea or coffee facilities in the suite.  The tv in bathroom didn't work.
356,"The service is soso. When we check in got to the hotel room, both keys not working, the 3 day came back from the show, the room key not working, we called 4 times, the house keeper who was passing by told us she cannot open the door for us, after she was done, saw us still waiting, she called for us, then we see the engineer after more then 20 minutes waiting, he confirm the key is not working as we already knows."
357,The fact I had to walk for a while to reach the lift.. the property is so big that you always have to carry your flats with you.
358,"Smoking in the casino. The gusts in the outdoor park, poolarea. The park was closed one day."
359,Wi Fi has a good coverage throughout the surroundings but it has certification issues. I kept getting warnings about the certification and recommendations not to use the hotel Wi Fi.
360,"Ate in the grand lux cafe- found the service very poor, the waiter forgot to bring one of the starters.. Ordered the steaks medium, they were served rare, sent them back and they were returned rare again. Would not return to this restaurant."
361,"During weekends, there is a beach party by the main pool, this creates a horrible noise, there are other pools but this seems to be the only one that gets the sun!"
362,"Not great value for money. At $500 a night I don't want a view of all the aircon ducts. Felt dated inside too - freyed carpet, toilet door not closing properly - little things you expect to be perfect for that sort of money. Location is the big selling point."
363,Loosing bucks at the casino Grrr .
364,"Amount of miles put on the car while with the valet parking, shame about all the additional payment even though the price had been paid through booking.com"
365,"We were four woman sharing a sub-par hair dryer!  After traveling for 2 weeks prior to various other hotels, we were surprised the hair dryer at The Venetian was so low powered."
366,Nothing
367,"The worst staff I've ever dealt with. I literally waited for about half an hour for someone to pick up the phone to take my request. The hotel is way understaffed. It takes about 7 minutes to go from my room to the reception and then join the long queue there. This is why I waited with my luggage outside my room for 40 minutes as the key was not working after I checked in. These things do not mean that the staff were rude or anything like that. It just the fact that it's a complete mess.
I will never go back to this hotel again."
368,"Maid servicing of the rooms each day was very inconsistent despite tips being left everyday. Some days the place was left really clean, other days it was like no one had serviced the room."
369,Very little not to like with this property. It has everything there. You could spend 4 days there and not see everything
370,"Long line for check in, waited 20 minutes even at 1 am.  Paper coffee cups at Bouchon kiosk leaked. Coffee itself was excellent!  When we mentioned it, they gave us our coffee free and double-cupped it.  The casino floor is loud and smoky smelling (although they do an admirable job of filtering the smoke out, it's not smoky looking).  By the time we'd left we had figured out how to exit the hotel without having to pass through the casino."
371,I would like it if there were hard pillow available in the room!
372,That you have to pay the high resort fee even though you don't use any other facility than your room. We knew it would be like that but it doesn't make it better.
373,"i ordered a cake and some other gifts for my sisters birthday two days before arrival and was going to have them delivered to the room for 1pm on day, however, when we came back to room singing happy birthday the room was empty.  We looked like idiots..  I went down to concierge and they had the cake sent up right away, and the gifts came to the room at 5pm.  So, the surprise was ruined and i still had to leave the room to coordinate the times when i had done it two days in advance already.  Very annoying, floral sent up an extra cheese basket but it still ruined the surprise and took my time away from my party for an hour to go deal with it.  I was trying to avoid that, to make it seem that much more special.  It was annoying at the least.  
Also, there is way to much smoking in the venetian, it was disgusting to walk around in plumes of smoke."
374,need a map to get around its just so big got lost a lot (not a bad thing though)
375,Gondalas were quite pricey.
376,The difficulty to speak to someone at the front desk from the room phone.
377,"they are pushing u to buy  for good view room .if u didnt do ..they r giving very bad room without nothing to see..
they havent intersting w u ..r u ok or all is ok ..etc
to much expensive for that kind of service.
cleaner people was very kind and helpfull.other staff was not kind and no smile..
pool bar staff was not kind.they r working in there very agresive and dont wanna do their job.that hotel has to educate their staff emergency."
378,"We did not appreciate being charged $48 for refreshments in our room we did not use. Said amount was returned, however, once we called them, without any particular fuss."
379,"Its a very busy hotel/casino/convention center with 7000 guest rooms!
The booking.com price did not include the compulsory 'resort fee' $35 nor the city tax $50 odd so theres an extra $85 a night extra you dont expect.  
Like so much in Vegas, it's a money making machine.   Restaurants, Cafes etc are all wildly overpriced (+ don't forget the 20-25% tips!). 
Finding your way around the hotel is difficult as they make sure you have to walk through the Casino to get to your room!
Although it looks like a 5* hotel a lot of detail is missing in order to cut costs.  
Towels are tired, table tops scratched, soaps are cheap etc etc (I suspect they use a lot of produce from their Macao/Chinese location)."
380,"Hate the additional $32 per night resort fees which include items such as wifi, gym use and boarding pass pringreat ting,  all of which should be included in the room rate. Rip off."
381,Extra blankets and towels didn't come with the room by default and were a little hard to obtain. The in-room phones didn't work.
382,No coffee facility in room and a 500 yard walk to pick up the free coffee every morning
383,The check-in starts at 3pm but that doesn't mean that the room will be ready by then. Cleaning staff has up to 5pm to prepare rooms which means that you could have to wait. Very frustrating for a hotel of that category / price.
384,"Nothing really. Maybe the fact we easily got lost a few times in the hotel but it is like that in all the Vegas hotels. There was nothing we didn't like about the hotel itself. Had the best time here, just wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the pools more."
385,Nothing! This hotel was perfect!
386,Nothing!
387,"The resort fees were more expensive than was stated by Booking.com when I made the booking.
Outside Gondola ride is poor value for money"
388,"Room had no soap and when we asked for some the maid all but accused us of stealing it.  Also, I never received the promised checkout confirmation."
389,"No one to help with luggage at the main doors.
Did not appreciate the persistence of the cosmetic sellers."
390,You had to walk through the gaming/casino area to get to the rooms. There was no dedicated hotel breakfast area. The lobby felt like a train station.
391,"The room keys did not work on two occasions, so we had to go the long way back to the reception to Fix it.
The pool area was very crowded, and there were no sun umbrellas available. Also, the pool beds were crammed together so that you were sitting 5cm from a total stranger.
They had pressure sensors in the mini bar which meant we could not use the mini bar to store any of our drinks.
It's a long walk from your room to the reception, parking, the strip etc. Not very convinient."
392,Paid quite a bit for wi fi which wasn't very good and didn't work from the bed so couldn't watch netflix in bed.
393,"Lack of sun loungers due to other guest leaving towels on loungers once they had left, or guests hogging the loungers for hours leaving a top for example on them. This resulted in many people not gettin a sun lounger or groups having to split up. This isn't the fault of the hotel, but they could look to manage this selfish behavior."
394,"This is far from a 5 star hotel, much more in the 4 star bracket compared to European standards. no evening TD service, no luggage porters, no rooming. the hotel of course is also massive, so expect to walk for an hour to get to your room!"
395,"Service to the rooms was relatively slow/non existent in some cases? Stood in line at midnight for 45 minute to check in after a long day of travel. In another instance we asked from an extra blanket, told we could expect it in 20-30mins and never received anything. Maybe not enough staff to handle the Labor Day weekend?"
396,That there was no fridge space for personal use or tea making facilities.
397,"I will not be staying at this hotel again due to their customer service. I had issues with  booking this hotel and them not wanting to help me once my reservations were cancelled....if it was not for booking.com that helped me i would have stayed somewhere else but trust and believe i will not be giving my money to the venetian EVER AGAIN. Also one of the customer service reps at the front desk name Jessica was really rude and just nasty, and not to me but other customers as well. They also charged me an extra $7-8 when i was only suppose to pay what was stated when i booked this through booking.com"
398,No tea and coffee making facilities in the room. No fridge for us to put our own drinks in - only a mini bar which charged as soon as an item was removed.   No water left in the room for teeth brushing etc.Gondola rides were pretty pricey for a family of 4.
399,The cleanliness.
400,"The main pool was overwhelmed by party people, but there was a smaller pool area which was calmer except for all the families.  The resort fee is now up to $35.84 a day.  You do get free Wifi and access to Canyon Ranch Spa.  May want to opt out if neither a high priority."
401,"Room dark and needs more lighting. Also when you book a suite, a small refrigerator should be included at no charge.Thought the spa prices were ridiculous"
402,"The Venetian and The Palazzo are from the same company, we booked with The Venetian but they sent us to The Palazzo for some reason."
403,"The place is too big. There are actually 3 different hotels inside (Venetian, Venezia an Palazzo) which makes the walking really long and everytime you need to reach a restaurant or something, it takes 15min or more.
The pool service stopped at 6pm in some pools... 
Also in other places the pool area is greener and ""cooler"""
404,There was nothing I didn't like at all.
405,"Beer at casino was a little pricey  at $8 a bottle, but everything else was wonderful."
406,No coffee/ tea making facilities in room. Whilst bathrooms and bed linens were well cleaned no one cleaned down table tops in the bedroom and they were very dusty after our 5 night stay. Bottled water in room way too expensive.
407,"House keeping lady woke us up at 8:00 am in the morning. She opened the door with her own key. Don't forget to put the ""do not disturb"" tag outside if you don't want any house keeping service before 10:00 am."
408,No breakfast buffet in morning.
409,"Cold and faceless monster hotel. All about the volume, not the quality. You have a feeling of being processed rather than looked after. Staff are nice overall but a bit jaded - like the hotel. Long queues to check-in are a pain. And there's a number of large dollar hidden charges like the resort fee which with other taxes added I think 30% to the already expensive price. Which isn't the best welcome off a long haul flight. Good quality is average, mostly processed for speed and volume."
410,"Very large hotel/resort, which can be bewildering to find one's way around."
411,"Most of the pools were closed. Loud music at the only open family pool. Drunk teenagers mixed with my kids, bad idea. I love a good party, but this was ridiculous. Make sure you have a family friendly pool! We actually checked out a day early because we could not even go to the pool normally :("
412,Our room did not come with a price list for the mini bar nor any type of hotel guide. The couch in the sitting area was uncomfortable to sit in. The ice buckets were really just too small.
413,Bathroom was a little dirty... Grout in tiles was grimey and the mirrors were dirty.
414,"Check in was very lack luster compared to other 5 star hotels in Vegas.  We did not feel welcomed.  The internet was terrible and since we needed it for work, my husband complained about the quality only to be told the ""included"" internet could be upgraded for a fee.
We wanted a quick breakfast one morning and didn't want to wait in the huge lines at the restaurants so went to the ""fast food"" section for a breakfast.  It was horrible, toast wasn't buttered or offered, hash browns were raw.  The pools were very packed due to summer and not enough staff on to accommodate service."
415,"Very big hotel, so lots of walking from the main entrance to the room via two lifts.Confusing layout of property especially for first time guest. Little bit longer distance to get to amenities."
416,"When we checked-in, the rooms that we ordered were not available, although we ordered them months ago (we are a family of 5).
The staff tried to make us take inferior rooms without telling the truth about them (for example: a queen bed instead of a king bed, or a high accessibility room, that doesn't have doors to the rest room) and eventually put us in their sister hotel, the Palazzo (the rooms are identical but the hotel is smaller and less fancy). One of the kids slept on the opened sofa instead of a queen bed as we ordered."
417,Paid extra for a view and wasn't that great .
418,"easy to loose your bearings, took us nearly an hour to find our room after going out onto the Las Vegas Strip"
419,"No coffee facilities in room. Smart plan not good value if you are not drinking in casino, free coffee  was long walk from room and limited online magazine access."
420,"Staff specially the security team being rude and arrogant (definitely not expected from a 5 star hotel!)
Not enough beds by the pools and that they close all pools but one or two during busy hours."
421,The fridge was not useable as it was full of Venetian items.  If you move one if those items the sensor records it and it is charged to your bill so no where to put your own drinks in summer heat.  Very user unfriendly and very annoying!
422,"Housekeeping very poor , No free water to drink in the Luxury Suite at least once ! No kettle so you can make a coffee!!"
423,"I didn't like the fact I had no Tea and coffee complimentary  .and you tried to 
Charge me for a Mars I hadn't had ..$10 ."
424,the size of the place easy to get lost
425,"Pool area and pool not great for families
So big, it feel very impersonal
Felt more like a shopping center than hotel, but that's Vegas!"
426,"Booking.com didn't explain how the resort credit worked very well, they block £400 on your credit card. Which could have come in handy for shopping."
427,"Resort fee which covers local calls (not used) newspaper (not used) and wifi (this does not work adequately in the room but works sporadically in communal areas where free wifi is available anyway for occasional visitors) the hotel should do away with this resort fee and just add the cost onto the actual booking of the room. Nobody would complain as the hotel is beautiful. People will complain if the resort fee is charged for something that doesn't work!
My only other complaint was at check in. I was made to feel cheap by refusing to pay extra for a room with s view of the strip. The staff members then explained that we would be given a key each as 'he' pointed to my room mate, may lose it! She then said what is his name anyway? thus was unprofessional and the reason why I didn't give the highest score for staff. Other than this all personnel were great."
428,I just hate thesmell of smoke when i pass the casno areas.
429,We couldn't get a space around any of the pools at 5pm... Shame as we were really looking forward to relaxing with a cocktail around the pool.
430,"This hotel is a cheap, trashy place, that feels as if you are in LAX airport. It is not a resort surely - they lack a quiet swimming pool area (no kids policy) or a quiet lobby area. There is not enough of daylight in the hotel or even in the outside pool areas. The outside pool areas are messy, crowded, look dirty. It is difficult to receive any information about hotel premises since the info leaflet is aimed to look fancy (yet super messy), concierge line is not available (loooong wait time) and the walk from your suite to concierge counter is also way tooo long. Same goes for in-room dining: wait time is 1hour. getting breakfast in that hotel should become an Olympic discipline, since it is a challenge (everything overcrowded with crazy wait time). Staff doesnt seem genuine. Hotel spa is an overkill - took me 30min to get my treatments scheduled cos the counter assistant was so slow and uninformed about the treatments."
431,"Very poor slow wi-fi (part of USD 30 resort fee), for better one was necessary to pay another USD 10. Minibar without possibility to put own drinks in. No leaflet or book with basic information about internet, TV, check-out, swimming pools etc."
432,The pool was big but not very clean. The drinks at the pool at was extremely expensive.
433,The walls/doors are thin I could hear people walking by my room
434,I will never book thru a 3rd party booking! It was my dgtrs 21st BD and we had MAJOR difficulty checking in even though I made the reservation a month in advance! The hotel also should be a little more transparent in their requirements like having to pay for the second night in person! NO WHERE did it tell me she would need a credit card or I would have been prepared. We are in another state and it was very stressful to have to deal with at least 3 different people while my daughter was in tears! Not good!
435,"I know it is lame to mention it but would be nice if there were slippers, I'm kinda of guy how collect hotels silppers as souvenir"
436,Nothing
437,Maybe they shoul renouvate some rooms
438,"Honestly this place was not worth the money that we had paid for. As a 5 star hotel I expected a lot more than rude, drunk, tawdry people roaming around in skimpy swimwear. The service was also not on par for a 5 star hotel, our room was not entirely clean(there were hairs in the shower drain) even when we first got in, the cleaning ladies didn't make much attempt to clean the next day either. Our door lock was completely faulty, the locks would take up to 20 attempts (no exaggeration, we'd cheer the one time that it took only 3 attempts) to finally work. They need to replace their locks! We visited the pools in the afternoon and with the amount of people in it you would think that it's a public pool. It's honestly best not to go into the pools, no amount of chlorine can kill all those diseases."
439,"Low down the strip, it's more lively towards the cosmopolitan and bellagio. Decor is a bit dated / old fashioned. Concierge was useless. No contacts for any club hosts, couldn't help organise any tours; simply handing the odd leaflet.  Gave us free entry to Tao, the in hotel club, but that is a rubbish club."
440,"Issues at check in due to incorrect information provided by booking.com also $100 dollar deposit taken on arrival for extras which didn't mind standard practice but you weren't able to charge room service to your room? Reception staff we encountered were ""cold"" and uninterested."
441,"The smell of smoke at the casinos ( and you can't avoid it since you have walk pass/ through the area to get to the elevators for the rooms)
NO complementary coffee in the room! But a display of all sorts of snacks and drinks for absurd prices."
442,The one thing I missed the most was that we had no coffee and tea facilities but this is normal practice in most American hotels.
443,As it is such a big hotel it is easy to get lost or lose your bearings. Clearer signs would help avoid this!
444,Pool beds too close to one another lacking a bit of intimacy between groups
445,"Occupancy charge per night added $154 for our stay, hidden cost"
446,"You can smoke in the casinos in Vegas/Nevada.  Not used to it anymore.  To get to another part of the hotel you often had to cross the casino - no easy/quick way around it and it's disgusting.  
Too hot to take advantage of the pools in July/August - 105+ degrees at 6pm."
447,"More shade is absolutely needed around the pool areas.  It is a necessity if only to ensure the health of the many children we saw exposed to 100'F+ heat without the protection of shade.  Please, the wonderful Venetian, sort it out!!  Also please more signs to guest elevators/suites - we weren't the only ones  wandering around like lost souls!"
448,The long hallways.
449,Too expensive not worththe $ rude people next door theft etc... wont be staying here again and gondalos inside is a rip off.
450,Expensive to eat or drink unless you hunt around or go outside. Additional fee per room per night fee to cover wifi and gym etc which I think should be included in room price - and it does add up.
451,"The swimming pool rules, the life guards are not police! Blowing whistles every 2 minutes, we are not children... I'm it going to spill my drink in the pool, Closing the pool 4pm and cramming everyone into one pool is ridiculous, we are booked for another 2 days here but are checking out early to go to another hotel,with less pool rules"
452,The only thing I didn't care for was leaving a $100 deposit from my account on Wednesday and I still haven't been credited back my money. I didn't have any condiments to be charged to my room.
453,"overcharged. With booking.com they told me it was going to be 569€ plus 32 usd x2 for the resort fee plus then taxes of 9% or so (635€ approx) and in the end a total of 827€ were charged, i.e. about 200usd extra with no consumption at all."
454,"Everything perfect.
Venetian could be privileged with their own Hertz collection/ return bureau."
455,They don't have good shows like all the good artists play in ceasor palace .
456,The room didnt have a kettle to make tea
457,The hotel needs an renovation and should put up a higher dress code.
458,The car park was quite a walk.
459,I ordered room service once and think it gave my boyfriend food poisoning. I didn't eat any of it so I was fine but he was throwing up all night. We are both vegan and he ordered the hummus wrap which is one of the only vegan options for room service.
460,Room service food was terrible & way overpriced.  The order was incorrect.
461,The Pool area is really crowded and there are no places in the shade you even have to pay for them.  The Pools could be cleaner.
462,"Everything is so expensive!  The fully-stocked mini bar was so tempting but I didn't dare touch anything incase I inadvertently got charged - a weeny bottle of champagne was $39!  Noise around the pool from the Tao Beach Club was a bit off-putting at times.  My request for a decent view wasn't met, despite it being my 25th wedding anniversary - not unless I wanted to pay a whole heap more cash!  The only acknowledgement I got of our special occasion, was a typed letter on arrival saying someone could put together an itinerary for me if I so wished - very generous, I'm sure!  A bottle of wine or some flowers in the room, or a room with a view other than  over the aeroplane runway would have been a nice gesture!"
463,"Room service was terrible for a vegas hotel. Over an hour, arrived cold and was the wrong order..."
464,"Shower was okay, but would have liked a power shower. Didn't like having to pay 150 dollars per day for incidentals, none of which I used, as when this is refunded to your card you lose money on fees and exchange rates. However, upon check out this was really well dealt with by refunding me the resort fee as recompense, so very happy."
465,More like staying on a shopping mall than a 5 star hotel. Quite dated too & would have been nice to have breakfast included as standard.
466,"It's such a huge place, it's very confusing to find things & then you end up walking forever & possibly getting lost! Good floor/area maps needed."
467,"Everything was good but the pools were dirty that i couldnt swim comfortably 
And the walk from the lobby to the room took us a good 10 mn walk plus 2 elevators to go to the second tower but thats not much of an issue because the hotel is soo big"
468,"Minor issues:
The shower rose needed more holes as I didn't really feel like I got very wet.  Although I do understand that being in a desert water can be an issue. 
Some of the pools were closed until 3 even though there was a guard there and the other pool was quite crowded."
469,The casino had too many high tech machines. We are old school and I guess we haven't caught up with the times . Maybe a retro section would be helpful .
470,annoying wave music by the pools because the outdoor club is right there.  it really took away the relaxing mood that we were looking for
471,Despite staff trying you are a bit of a number. They can't hide that the hotel is huge.
472,There was no drinking water in the room neither kettle or complementary tea/coffee which is always now provided by 5* hotels
473,N/A
474,"That the distance from room to lobby is so long, you need to cross the casino, our room key didn't work so it was quit a trip to get a replacement."
475,"Bathroom robes had seen better days & needed replacing ,they were old & scratchy.
Wifi connection was non existent in the room .
No DVD player or CD player in the room even though booking.com said it was included
No free newspaper even though booking.com said it was included
Pool area needed a spruce up , no umbrella's for shade. You were all packed in like sardines around the pool area .
Music was way too loud & booming reverberated in all pool area's."
476,"Some of the amenities are not included and we were told our room had no view and were kind of forced to upgrade to a more expensive one, which wasn't very nice."
477,Got a room with an outside courtyard but was in like a basement area. Only 4m high walls to look at & a kitchen extract which made the area smell of cooking all the time.
478,Not the best location on the strip.  Most of the more fun hotels are further south.
479,"I took a phone call to Australia from the hotel room. That cost me USD114 (yes, you read it correct 114) for less than 15 minute call placed in a very tense situation. Make sure you don't use the telephone provided in the room."
480,"After confirming my reservations through Booking.com more then a week in advance, I was surprised and upset when I was told at the front desk that the suite that I had booked was not available. We had to stay in a handicapped enabled room for one night and we never got the view that we paid for during the whole stay. The service was very impersonal and unprofessional at best. To add on to the situation, I was billed for the smart plan which I had cancelled upon my check in, only to find out when we arrived back home that I was charged for it. Still waiting for the refund."
481,"We asked for in room refridge - they did bring, but did not work.  They did bring another one so it was ok.  
Pools - they have many, but they are all smaller and crowded.  
One of the pools was so dirty when we were there, that we got lumps of white stuff and hairs all over us.   I have a pool at home, and I can tell you this was not a well cared for pool .  
 Wish they would invest in better pools, as we adored the rest of the stay and that would make a big difference.  Overall loved it."
482,"The wifi was pretty poor, no breakfast included, the iPod dock was for the old iPhones.
 It's really nice but I think for the money I expected everything to be perfect."
483,"The Venezia tower rooms are becoming very dated and jaded,2 elevators to get to the room and you are further away from the casino,food court and parking garage."
484,"Cleaning of the rooms can be improved. We found the keys of our room dated month of may under our bed (we stayed in August) - so noone really cleaned the floor fully since May.
Crowds of people everywhere but this is Vegas."
485,We have extended check out for one of the rooms. But they still check us out even we pay money for it. And it took about 45 minutes to unlock the room
486,Having to ask more than once for luggage to be delivered to room.  The lock on one of our rooms was broken had to be replaced. No apology from hotel and had to chase them to respond.
487,"Quieter areas to bathe. There was a constant 'boom-boom' due to a beach pool party.
Otherwise pretty perfect."
488,The wifi in the room was terrible but was good everywhere else in the hotel. Only complaint!
489,Coffee making facilities in the rooms would be great.  But that's just a teeny weeny point
490,"Normal wifi was useless on iPhone. Had to pay tier 2 to make it work at acceptable speed.
Had to move from level 5 to level 24 due to noise of hotels outside aricon system - very noisy."
491,If you need shade at the pool I suggest reserving a cabana as there are no umbrellas at the pool. We missed having a coffee maker in the room however coffee shops are nearby.
492,"Our room was a long way, three lift rides from the main pool.
Problem booking through Booking.com. We were overcharged on one room for a child under 13 (the hotel does not charge for children under 13) and we did not receive free breakfasts for our five night stay, on the two rooms booked, as listed on the website and our booking confirmation."
493,We didn't like the fact that Smoking is allows in the Casino area.
494,"Front desk lady and her manager named AJ.
We are family with 3 girls and 3boys
Booked 3 rooms she and her manager didn't do any thing to help us even  though we requested that at booking and we call hotel in the morning while we were traveling from LA to Vegas they try to sell us different room up grade"
495,No coffee in the rooms. Would have been great
496,"No coffee maker in room (only to discover you can get a free one per adult somwhere in the foodcourt once leaving)
Relatively expensive (25$! For 3 icecreams), but then again it is Vegas.
Free wifi is slow. LTE connection was better and faster
You pay 35$ resort fee bit do not get explained what it is for"
497,It takes forever to get out on to the strip via the shopping malls (but this seems to be the case with all the big hotels). It is expensive (but everything in Vegas is) but worth it. Having been into Circus Circus and Excalibur (other options for kid themed hotels for our stay) we definitely made the right choice; those are tired and shady inside. If I were to go back I would not stay anywhere else but Venetian.
498,I asked them to keep some synthetic ice I need to keep cold some medicines in one of their freezer and they refused! I think that similar things should never happen in a hotel of such a high level!
499,"The hotel was so giant we had to take two separate elevators, and use a map, to get to the room but that's to be expected on the strip I suppose!"
500,I didn't have any complaints on the Venetian part.  But the fellow visitors extremely loud when walking down the hall.  But other than that I would definitely be coming back.
501,"The frigi in room is fully sensor ed thus if you remove anything you will be immediately charged for it, this prevent us from getting cold water which is much needed in the heat of Las Vegas, as the hotel is really huge there are always queues on everything from elevators to check in and you name it, if you have a car with valet make sure you order it enough time in advance as it takes 30 mins for valet to deliver car and thus it could be you loose your show if not counting for that, I didn't also like the high priced food in hotel resturants but this is expected in Vegas as a touristic hub"
502,"when I was check in, the front desk ask me to upgrade the room without clear indication that would be charged extra money
Until I checked out, it was surprised to see that I was charged for a huge extra money while I had prepaid for the room before."
503,It was very hot and there was a shortage of deck chairs by the pools
504,Doors in the suite didn't close very easily.
505,"Nightly rate was too high, additional resort fee did not cover exercise equipment (?). Drink purchases about 3 x normal cost."
506,"cannot use the refrigerator, no water provided in the room, room too far away (since it is a big hotel with many rooms)"
507,"I didn't like the fact that you have to take two different elevators to get to the suite I find that cumbersome.
Staff were not top noch, they didn't belong to this resort.
Suite didn't get cleaned well.
The water is harsh."
508,"No fridge, it is full with mini bar items that auto charge of they're removed. Check in queues far too long for the money that you pay"
509,"The bottled water inside the fridge are chargeable which is fine, but those on top of the cupboards are also chargeable! I thought they were complimentary and finished them for usd24."
510,"A very noisy hotel - we had to move rooms when a party was going on in the room next door . Upgraded to a larger, higher suite at a reduced price, which was worth the money to get away from the raucous partying in the next room - all day ! Staff very helpful in moving us quickly."
511,The hallway was not clean - overflowing trash cans that were there in the evening as well as the following morning.
512,"In spite of all efforts to ""eat"" smoke, I still find the common casino area too smoky. When moving away from the convention center there is a huge difference in the air quality."
513,"- swimming pools overcrowded and loud (this is likely the same in other hotels)
- free Wifi useless
- housekeeping : we staid 3 nights. The room was not serviced for the 2 days and we had to ask several times. We reported a complaint  to the front desk. The way this issue was solved was professional though."
514,"Do not , and I mean do not, expect 5-star hotel service. I asked for dental kits and a kettle to make hot milk for the baby, and I waited an hour, to get them. 
The food courts on the lobby floor provide cheaper food choices and that's why the service is terrible !!!!! They don't smile and it seems you are spoiling their day."
515,"Very noisy guests next door,but that is not the hotels fault! When reported security acted quickly and courteously."
516,"Hotel was massive upgraded to a better room in the plazzio side and with a strip view but by the end of the week we all had blisters on our feet so wish I stayed in the Venetian as the pools / food courts were in the Venetian side , both hotels are the same building but BIG"
517,"They place the towels in the shower, so a friend ended up soaking them because the shower head shot at absurd angles. Lots of up and down on elevators to get around to certain floors, I think mostly to keep hotel guests safe but sometimes it was just a bit inconvenient."
518,"Requested early check in from 9-10 but there is no point on that because they don't start preparing you a room until you get there. Totally sucked for us because we had an event to attend at 11, that was our whole point of early check in. So we were expecting to have our room ready as soon as we got there to get situated. Also, receptionist was a little rude, at time of check in."
519,Couldn't fault the place.
520,Better detail cleaning and use of a fridge or something bigger than ice bucket
521,The queues at check in and out were pretty big but they staffed the desks well and they move quite quickly.
522,Couldn't fault the Venetian !! Recommend to anyone wanting 1st class accommodation !!
523,"Electronic fridge  one small shelf
To place an item 
No microwave or coffee maker
In room"
524,"Checked in at the Venetian, hotel full.  Moved to Palazzo.  Complicated with valet.  Glass fragments in room and my husband stepped on glass.  Housekeeping forgot room one day."
525,Resort fee bumps underlying price a lot. Just be honest and add into the standard rate as it is a mandatory charge
526,My rooms door lock was pretty annoying took 5-10 swipes to get the thing to open every time
527,The heat...it was 115 F outside.
528,"SLOW INTERNET CONNECTION.
ROOM CLEANING IS UPON DAILY REQUAST."
529,No tea or coffee making facilities in the room.
530,"The front desk wrote down the wrong room number while checking in 
The safe in the room was already closed when entering the room"
531,"It was 110 degrees and there were no umbrellas around the pool unless you rented a cabana.  It was too hot to lie out in the sun without shade, so we didn't get a chance to relax."
532,Wifi didn't work in our bed room.
533,We waited a long time for valet parking guy to get our car. The hotel was super crowded. When we checked out we would like a bellman but the staff told us there was a 30 min line! Would never stay in this hotel again. Venetian is too famous to live in
534,We cant think of anything we enjoyed ourselves and look forward to come back.
535,"Pool was disgusting with scum and body fats building up in corners, as a pool maintenance person I wouldn't swim in them."
536,The suite we were in was at the end. We didn't not have any closer elevators next to us. Overall not a good experience.
537,Desire to get you lost at every opportunity so you'd end up back at the Casino - or maybe that was just me :-)
538,"Depravity in the streets outside, feeling that the hotel was intent on draining my wallet at every opportunity, feeling that I was a being processed by a machine rather than entertained by a host - whole stay lacked human warmth."
539,"This is a huge hotel, so the staff didn't take the time to get to know us or find out what we were looking for. You can't use the fridge at all because the mini bar is weighted and they charge you if anything moves. The smoking in the casino was off putting. We didn't gamble much because of this. They should have a non-smoking area."
540,The bathtoom toiletries are not being  replace with a new 1 on the next day. And the guest service not helpful.
541,At room the Internet was pour ...
542,"Crowded at all times, older feel to the room, could probably do better for the money being spent"
543,Everything in Vegas is expensive and the food is overpriced and not that great.
544,Bathroom could have been slightly cleaner around taps etc. Hadn't spotted the additional resort fee that was payable so that was an unpleasant shock.
545,Didn't like that there is no tea or coffee facilities in the rooms.
546,"There wasn't any tea or coffee facilities. When I asked for some, I was told I had to go to the mall to purchase a cup of tea. This took about 30 mins round trip each morning! The operator didn't even suggest room service."
547,"The Cigarrette smell.  Got sick due to not being able to breathe and I was staying on the 33rd.floor. Although it must be hard for you guys, you should invest every so often and find ways to keep your air clean, by changing the air ducts or maintaining them so you can save us from ""nose bleeding"", ""chest congestion"" ""headaches""  I must say that Vegas is a city where almost every hotel has this problem, but that is exactly why I want to ask you Venetian, to be better and think of our lungs. Just try it!
We pay top dollar for our stay, so please consider your fans :)
Thanks!"
548,You need to go into one of the many food areas to choose breakfast.
549,"Very expensive and lots of extras to pay for, no tea and coffee facilities in room, staff not very helpful at all I was sick one evening and they refused to give us water so I could take my medicine I had to pay $4 for it!!"
550,"Slow internet, I have to walk like 5 minutes and take two elevator till I arrived to lobby plus 20 min waiting for my car.
They charge me additional money after I checked out and get my final bill.
I'll never stay there again"
551,No negatives!
552,The hotel was So Big .... Lots of Walking.
553,"Even though the room was awesome, it was more than we needed because we spent most of our time out of it. And I think we paid more than we needed to for that big, luxurious room. Next time, I'll probably try to save some money by looking something smaller. If I can do that at the Venetian, then I will be back!"
554,"The rooms were smaller than other similar priced rooms, the facilities are mostly all in the Palazzo and you have to walk FOREVER to get anywhere. And worst of all, there is cigarette smoke EVERYWHERE-- your clothes and hair stink of smoke even if you are just going from your room to the front door/taxi.  Noise also travels a lot so the room is very noisy."
555,"I was offended by the quality, security, and location of the parking garage and the fact that there was a hidden resort fee added to my bill. The staff recommended Merrrils Steak House as the best for dining! It was not, in fact the wait staff could not communicate the menu properly and the meal was at best mediocre. The stake was overpriced, undercooked, and cold. The baked potato was undercooked and difficult to consume the temperature of the potato had no effect on the butter!"
556,"Unable to use resort credit at certain stores even though they were on the applicable resort credit list (i.e. Lobster Me, Carlos' Bakery). The smell of cigarettes when walking through casino."
557,"- Slightly untidy bathroom and bedspread (or whatever the small ornamental thing is on the bed) for what we expected, however the issue was resolved immediately when we mentioned about it"
558,"A lot of the restaurants at the Venetian were closed for private parties, due to a large convention.(it was Las Vegas restaurant week) It would have been good to know in advance that this was going to be the case. Would have picked a different week to stay."
559,"The parking arrangement was very confusing, even with the Valet service which is to the far left side around the corner. We got sent all the way into the parking garage's valet which is for the Canal Shoppes and had to come all the way down and find our way back to the far left side of the front of the hotel."
560,WiFi wasn't that great. As it's so maybe it's pretty hard to work your way around and the signage isn't great.
561,"The room  needs a refrigerator that you can actually put leftovers and water in (it is stocked with beer, drinks that you pay for) and a coffee maker."
562,"Service really poor and reported this twice, directly to management, without any feedback or reply.
Nothing in the hotel was op to eat early afternoon.   Shocker!
Rooms are 20 minute walk from reception."
563,Air conditioning on the hallways too cold - always needed a jacket. Very long ways to reach room from lobby.
564,It was hot but that has nothing to do with the hotel.
565,"Don't go to the Bouchon, the hostess and staff don't give a damn about you.
Room cleaning was below expected."
566,Rooms are not meant for family stays. No complimentary water or coffeemaker machine in the room. Worst was the bathroom which was stinking.
567,Grazie membership was totally confusing and we didn't really take advantage of it.
568,"People smoking at swimming pool while there were also children, it can't be that difficult to stop smoking for the time at the swimming pool."
569,No tea maker in room. Travelled with an young child and hot water to be called from room service would take an hour.
570,Turned out it's cheaper to book on their official website than anywhere which also gives you extra credit for casino.
571,It was slightly more expensive than I would have liked.
572,"The staff is not helpful. When we arrived the reception desk at 2 a.m. , the staff just told me my room was cancelled with out a double check. And we have to explain a lot despite we were already exhausted. Although ,in the end, it was proved a mistake of the receptionist, he did give an apology at all. In addition, the wifi is quite poor..."
573,Not provide COFFEE MAKER MACHINE in room.
574,There's no tea kettle in the room. And what kind of a 5 star makes you carry your own bags to the room?
575,A little pricey for not including things like a kitchen or fridge for beverage storage.
576,"There is a charge for EVERYTHING, which is pretty standard for Las Vegas, but is also annoying. and be careful of the the ""refreshment bar"" it's weight sensitive so if you pick up an item for more than 30 seconds you will be charged for it"
577,There needs to be a his and hers light switch on either side of the bed. A detachable shower head would be great. No electric kettle. House keeping sometimes a bit rude and cleaning not excellent some days (we got chocolate some days and not others and the same for amenities - soaps etc) . Bedside radio needs updating.
578,"Booked around 6 months in advance and requested a smoking room. They didn't have a king smoking at check in but set me up with a double queen smoking room. The first room was terrible. There was trash in the drawers and cabnets and the drain on the tub was broken. The staff was very helpful after I called to complain. They cleaned the room and set me up with a king smoking room on the strip for the next three nights of my stay. They also waived all of the resort and wifi fees at checkout. Overall, I was very satisfied with how they made up for the shortfalls of my first night's stay."
579,"Difficulty when calling front desk for items like more towels .... No one would show up.... Called front desk several times and called house keeping, but it was a minor inconvenience. Overall really enjoyed our stay!!"
580,Would have liked a fridge that guests could use instead of one stocked with overpriced drinks-but that seems to be the norm in Vegas!
581,I couldn't complain about anything in this hotel
582,"Added fees for things. Resort fees, should be built into the advertised price. Paying extra for a fridge of your own to keep things as there is no room in their minibar fridge & if you even move stuff they know. Pools not open long enough in the heat of summer."
583,"They made a mistake at check in and give us an occupied room, they repair it with an upgrade for a room with an excellent view."
584,"I used the Valet parking and my car was in their care the entire time as I used a cab to get everywhere. When I got my car back I noticed a large dent and red paint on the passenger side. When I called and spoke to security to see video  footage the manager said they don't have security cameras, my car is an 06 and the dent could have been there (as if I don't know my own car and take care of it) and she spoke down on me which I didn't appreciate. For all of the money I spent there I definitely did not feel like a valued customer and nothing was done. Nothing was offered, no solutions. It's a beautiful place but I will never stay there again. EVER"
585,"Pool area, no shade except for buildings, no room to move as beds are lined up next to each other. Too many people and too little space.
Casino area all smoking except for one tiny uninteresting area, put us off spending time there.
Pride themselves on being the largest complex in LV with 7000 rooms, if full with an average of 2 people to a room thats 14,000 people - horrid, impersonal, not my cup of tea but if you want a brash, false, plastic environment in LV then this is it"
586,No Coffee/tea making facilities in the room which is not good when you have to travel half a mile to get to the nearest cafe in the morning. Food quite expensive. drinks very expensive (free apart from tip if you are at the tables)
587,"Breakfast is expensive (for the price it should be included), no ""personal touch"" from the staff"
588,It was very busy all the time some noisy people in the hall in the AM after a long night of partying...normal I guess
589,"It is a considerable distance from the front of the hotel to the rooms (it's a 7000 room hotel!) but if you follow the signs you won't get lost. 
Smoking is allowed in the casino and unfortunately you have to walk through the casino to get to and from the room. 
The pool filtration system didn't seem effective late on a hot day."
590,"Too far to Parking Area, Guest have to move bagage across CASINO to check in. Waiting too long during check in and out."
591,"1- its too big ,our suit was around 5 minutes walking and two elevators
2- rude staff at the swimming pool party, they forced us to walk all the way back to our suit to get our passport for age verification even though we are both above 43 years old,and when we brought the passport he didn't bother to open them.
3-every 5 star hotel in the world has a coffee machine in the room with complementary coffee,i was shocked that they dont have and they charge 22 dollars for a pot of coffee .
4- I Am A Type 1 Diabetic and on my last night before check out i needed to freeze my ice packs so i can keep my insulin cold,unfortunately even though we are in a a luxury suit but there is no freezer which i can understand,so i called room service so they can put my ice packs in the hotel freezer but they refused, i have don't that in every hotel i have been in the last 20 years and never been turned down.
5- my friend suggested that we can ask for ice bucket and put the ice packs inside it ,we called them they said we charge for ice and we paid 5-10 dollars for that i forgot the exact amount.  (we had no choice)
6- room service cleans the room and takes all the ashtray with her maybe because they want you to ask for them and tip them."
592,I had an excursion organized to grand Canyon was very hard to find the location of where the bus was waiting nearly missed my bus - not enough indications or signs. (made it at the end thank to the staff who were nice to point me to the right direction).
593,The wifi in the hotel was very temperamental and I struggled to have a connection at all.
594,No complementary items.not even tea or water. Have to pay for the electric cattle or any other thing. At Venetian nothing comes for free..I wonder they may not start charging to breath air..
595,Canal Shoppes area where people try to give you cheap show tickets by trying to get you to go to a timeshare resort presentation.
596,Nothing.  Everything met or exceeded expectations!
597,"Booking.com used my middle name as last name so it took longer to find the reservation, happened to us and friends we flew in with."
598,The rooms are tired and need to be updated. The mattress was way too soft and not comfortable.
599,Bedside light could only be turned off on one side which was difficult .
600,We were a bit disappointed with the shower as it was a little weak.
601,Poor odds on gaming tables.  6/5 pay on a blackjack and hitting soft 17 gives the house too big of an edge.  Comps are non-existent.  No real incentive to visit poker room.
602,Be very careful about the final bill. The price showing in booking.com is not the same as at the hotel when you check out. I arrived at noon but check in time was 3 Pm. Front desk talked me to take his deal which is 40$ more and I can go to my room now . I took the deal. When I check out I was charged 55$ plus tax more per nights. Every single nights we stayed. Very dishonest . Tricky .
603,I didn't like the tax and resort fee I feel I was overcharged because when I paid through booking.com it said the price is including the tax I paid 722dirhams on booking.com then I paid again in the resort 35dollars I don't for what.
604,The young teenagers were a bit noisy do not come over at weekends . the walls being a bit thin between the rooms allows the noise from the party next door to penetrate through.
605,All good but as sooooo vast it's very easy to lose your bearings....... Umbrellas needed by pool area with sun beds-gets very hot and NO shade!
606,"Noisy people at all times of night.
Don't touch anything in mini bar as you will get charged as if you have used the items, works on censors"
607,I got reservations for Venetian not palazzo and they charge for wifi.... We also found toys and a paper air plane when we walked in the room and a left cup full of milk in the fridge
608,Wifi was slow
609,"First of all we didn't know that the hotel has some very attractive poker room rates, if you play more than 6 hrs/ night you stay. My husband played and he found out from the dealer at the poker room.
Then the bad news was that the room rate was only available if the room was booked directly with the hotel, not via a third party, i.e. via booking.com. That was really disappointing. So next time I think we will book directly with the hotel."
610,The security looks at your face and decides if they wanna see your room key or not before letting you into the residence tower. I need not elaborate about which type of faces they ask for the key.
611,I didn't like how after paying all that money there was no fridge or coffee maker.
612,Only thing when I took a bath and drained the tub I wanted to shower but the drained backed up some from the tub.
613,Paid extra to upgrade to a view of the strip but we were right on the bend of the strip so didn't really get a view to speak of. Also charged an extra $5 for something out of the minibar but we didn't have anything from the minibar.
614,"Pool was very busy, almost impossible to get a chair past 10am, unless you pay the staff to kick others off them. Breakfast buffet was over rated for the price and selection. The bath tub and shower stall backed up brining stinky mess into bathroom- room was upgraded but still a hassle."
615,"There was nothing we didn't like, everything was perfect.  Tea/coffee facilities in the rooms would have been greatly appreciated just for that first morning cuppa."
616,"- given the high room prices I'd have expected, that a bottle of water is included in the price, but it wasn't
- due to the size of the hotel, it feld a little bit anonymous"
617,"Front desk staff rude and snobby! Had to call housekeeping on arrival as bins not emptied, ball of hair in shower and bar snacks opened and not replaced. 2 of us celebrating our 50th, one during our stay. A request for anything complimentary was flatly turned down. A glass of wine or slice of cake would have been appreciated.  Will try the Bellagio next year."
618,Dirty counter on mini bar. Otherwise not much I didn't like.
619,"Our paid upgrade to include a view wasn't as good as expected. Not a huge range of TV channels, and no guide. Additional 30% on menu prices for room service, plus gratuity (plus optional tip) - quite expensive."
620,The shower was a bit old.
621,"We were in another tower, which meant changing 2 lifts. It was a pain and also there was no breakfast available at the hotel. It became a problem with the little ones."
622,"Room cleaning is very late , mostly 3-5 p.m
not enough bath towels.
Houskiping staff is not enough ."
623,Room too far and not convenient. Too noisy at night so we had to change the room. The whole hotel was too busy and noisy.
624,No coffee and tea set to make warm tea or coffee in the morning. No complementary drink despite the room price.
625,"pool size,  must be more easy find exits, entrances, we never sow so a lot lost people in like labirints buildings. Food market's  food and service dangerously bad. Employee very aggressive and helpless."
626,Not enough room at the pool.
627,Just nothing.
628,The sheer size of the hotel made it very easy to get lost on multiple occassions!
629,"Week end rates a bit expensive especially when getting asked about upgrades when you are paying top dollar
I would suggest a comp upgrade if avail when paying week end rates"
630,"Booked a suite with view only saw the pool
No tea or coffee making facilities in room and mini bar is sensors so if you look at something you get charged for it"
631,"There's no free bottle water in room, you have to ask the front counter. We loose money in casino  :("
632,You are charged automatically if you move the things around in mini-bar. A clear and visible sign should be posted at the mini-bar to warn occupant. I have to call to reverse the charges.
633,"There was a guy his name was joseph , 10 pm he was trying to bargin us into a room with a double bed instead of giving us a room with a king size bed after the long argue he went to his manager and magically after him saying tht he had no room with king bed available he came up with one in 2 min. So just becareful , also no kettle in the room no tea no slippers"
634,It would have been better if we were able to stay 5 days!!!  lol
635,The location of the room was horrible. For this reason we chose to gamble at another hotel.
636,The price per night was little bit on the higher side comparing it to deals other hotels were having.
637,"having only spent 1 night, we wish we could have stayed longer."
638,"Over priced, no toilet roll in room, no kettle in room, not enough direction signs for a maze like network of corridors and lifts"
639,"Staff in the casino were rude, dismissive and generally quite miserable, particularly in comparison to some other hotels on the strip"
640,"Bit disappointed that there were no tea/coffee facilities provided, for the price you pay you would expect at least a complimentary bottle of water and tea/coffee supplies."
641,"Where do I even start! Appalling! The staff were awful. We arrived late
and tired and our reservation was for 2 non smoking luxury suites to be
told they only had smoking ones available. This is not okay and mu
parents who also stayed have horrid allergies you couldn't breathe
on the floor they Sent us and then told us if we wanted to move we
would be downgraded. We came to terms with this and had a major
struggle with the staff even wanting to help us. They were extremely
rude and to cancel they charge almost the whole cost of the stay. So we
got moved and were very thankful for it however there were other guests
partying with their doors open in the surrounding rooms as well as
running up and down the hallways screaming all night. I'm talking
even between 1-5am. Totally unacceptable. What did the hotel do?
Nothing - of course. I went to have a bath to find after I had filled
it up that I was sitting in a totally unclean bath with other
people's hair floating in it, totally gross! So I went to drain the
bath which actually made dirty sewerage (black smelly) come up the
drain of my shower. This is extremely disgusting. I have stayed at The
Tropicana before (on the end of the strip) for a whole week and hat was
amazing. You would think that paying 2-3 times the price and in a
better location, more ""prestigious"" hotel that is would be as
good as it seems. Totally disgusted with the cleanliness and service
received. Never. Again."
642,No Housekeeping. Our room was only cleaned after we complained it three times. The staff didn't take care about it. This is not a five star luxury hotel worthy. I was shortly before buying my own toilet paper at Walgreens. I'm not kidding.
643,- Had to call room service several times to remove the dishes after having a meal in the room.
644,There were some anomalies on on or check out bill that we were able to get corrected quickly.
645,"there were 3 of us...I took the sofa.  When I pulled out the hide-a-bed, I found damp soiled sheets, with used items in the sheets....very  unpleasant situation."
646,The only thing I missed was a kettle or coffee machine in the room .
647,"the hotel is so big, you end up walking alot."
648,The double doors to the bathroom looked good but weren't very practical. The hinges needed oiling too.  There was also a used cotton bud on the floor when we arrived.
649,"Service is very in efficiency. Wifi is tooooo bad, no connection! Noisy. Too difficult to find the room."
650,Wifi could be of a better speed/quality.
651,No coffee/tea facilities in the room. Surely this is a basic requirement that should be included within the daily resort fee.
652,"In my opinion I think the guest of the venetian should get deals on TAO nightclub, or the pool parties. I honestly thought we were going to get discounts or a deal on bottle service just for being a guest."
653,"Staff, especially the dealers in the casino, were super unfriendly.  I have been to several
different casinos and these dealers were the worst I've seen."
654,Hard to rate staff as had little interaction with them due to scale. Smell of casinos due to cigarette smoke off putting. We also asked for highest room available with a nice view. We got 11th floor so not particularly high and crappy view :(
655,"Too big and easy to get lost
Nearly everything in the room charges you."
656,"The view was ugly, but to be honest we didn't spend a lot of time in the room. Like with all American hotels, no price is ever up front. A variety of taxes and resort fees appear on your bill so expect to pay more than what's quoted on booking. Also I would advise buying bottled water from the shops - the in-room temptations (drinks and snacks) are extortionate."
657,"The room smelled bad every time I put the AC off, the Shower water pressure wasn't the best and there's a weird humidity smell as soon as you step into the lobby every day."
658,We arrived early and room was ready but charged extra to access room early - no other hotel has ever done this in any place I have been.
659,"The whole hotel was designed as a big labyrinth, leading you to the casino or to the shops. Not easy to navigate - 20 minutes walking, three lifts and many corridors to get from the car park to the room."
660,Pools were closed due to a little pouring rain..Often is was not even raining at all.
661,"The only problem that I could find with this hotel is that is it simply too big. It takes 2 elevator and 10 min walk just to get from your room to your car, and about the same time to exit the hotel."
662,Nothing!
663,The Smart Plan was overrated. The WiFi didn't work half the time and don't even think about streaming anything as promised. We found that where you could use the 50% off drinks was very limited and the Caffe Presse to get free coffee were in pretty inconvenient areas. Next time we'll skip the plan.
664,"The lighting in the bathroom wasn't the best, it was darker than what I was used to, which made it hard to get ready."
665,"No coffee facilities in the Room,
also we didn't like hearing the noise in the corridor of returning guests"
666,"You are just ONE of the many travelers coming to the Venetian, expect to queue up when you arrive, expect to be welcomed by a front-desk lady talking very fast to get through and to your credit card even faster. If you have already booked a ""Venetian suite"" the front-desk will try to upgrade your suite into an even better suite, making you feel like your suite is JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH. You have already paid 300-400 US$ per night!  There is a resort tax of ca. 15% per night to pay on top for every luxury hotel next to taxes. More expensive than planned. 
The room is dark but you get two TVs."
667,"We didn't like that the check-in clerk tried to convince us to upgrade to the ""floor up"" for an extra $45/night. When we asked what we would get for that, he assured us that we would get a ""much better view"". I'm not sure that a move from the 8th floor to the 9th changes the view all that much? We were entirely happy with the room we were allocated and were also very happy that we hadn't taken the ""one floor up"" option; it would have been a total waste of $90 (for the two nights we were there). Also, we both felt that the check-in agent was not at all welcoming but rather just going through the motions. Yes, we were on an Expedia deal, not sure that should make us second-class guests? We are well travelled and have stayed in literally thousands of hotels all over the world in our quite lengthy lives! This however is the only negative we have to add; we thought the Venetian, overall, was brilliant!"
668,"We checked in on Friday evening and were given a suite in the Venezia Tower; told that the tower had its own secluded pool which opened from 0630 and stayed open until 2230.  We got to the pool at around 1100 the following day.  It was busy and the sun was limited - the pool is completely surrounded by the tall hotel buildings and so often mostly in shade. Without any warning everyone in the area were suddenly (and quite rudely) cleared away by staff due to a 'private function'.  Several people asked to see the manager - 'not available'.  Were told to move to the main pool area.  All well and good but there were already 1000's people struggling to find anywhere to sit.  The pool area just does not cater for the number of guests.  2 days later, sun shining I headed to the main pool at 9am only to find it cordoned off - no details as to why it was closed. Have stayed in Bellagio and Wynn amongst other hotels and won't be visiting the Venetian again."
669,All the decor is too old grandma for my taste. Next time we are going to stay at a more updated hotel and will have to uber to the restaurants
670,They charged us for a late check out which we did not require; after three calls they gave me back the money.
671,"There was a trash bag next to our room for almost a whole day.
Considering the rest of the hotel, it was just a lapse, but an important one."
672,Room housekeeping was poor. Garbage left from last guest. All resort staff were grumpy and obviously did not enjoy their work. Resturants are overpriced and average food. Grand Lux Buffet very poor range and qualility public house wait staff had no customer focus. Overall very disappointing and poor value for money.
673,Complex facility--too much walking and multiple elevators to get from one place to another. You can get lost forever... Somewhat expensive
674,Cost of the gondola rides was a bit pricey. No amusement parlour facilities for the kids.
675,"During our four night stay, our suite was cleaned only once, and that was annoying."
676,"Paper thin doors 
We were there on the weekend and there was a lot of young adults screaming in the corridors all night long - really hard to try to sleep when that happens 
Also very long walk from the reception to our rooms, but it is a big complex"
677,Didn't experience any unpleasantness this trip
678,Internet is TERRIBLE - it dropped off constantly and often didn't work at all. I expected more from a hotel of this standard.
679,So many people that often had to queue at concierge.
680,I would have liked tea and coffee making facilities in the room
681,Nothing in particular. All was good.
682,The gentleman was not helpful when ordering room service first night we arrived. Then our food took 2 hours to arrive and the order was wrong!
683,Did not get room I wanted .paid extra for strip view Got pool view. Told that  was strip view. Also was offered bed turndown service. Your hotel does not have this.
684,"Gondola rides are good, but are overpriced and the ride time is short."
685,"Key cards deactivated regularly, which entailed a trip to the lobby, a considerable walk through the casino, and often a long line. This occurred at least once a day to each key card (traveled with a group, so several rooms). The hotel needs to update their room keys."
686,A bit overpriced compared to similar hotels offering same size rooms and amenities...about 35-40% pricier than others.
687,"HATED the way the advertised rate turned out to be $100 less than what we paid,we were assessed extra for early check in, with an ""option to move"" after one night-well that wasn't going to work very well.  Too many hidden fees!Left a bad taste, better to be up front."
688,"The check out process could have been more streamlined, but it falls in line with other hotels."
689,The staff. Most of the dealers at the tables were extremely non friendly and miserable. We went to many other casinos and the staff was fantastic. They were great to be around and pleasant.
690,"Just my personal preference but it is a little too far up the strip for me. It's easy to forget how vast each hotel is, and what might only appear to be 2 or 3 hotels away can easily be a 20-minute walk. 
The TV menu system is also slightly limited in that it doesn't give you a programme guide, just a list of channels... not that watching TV should be a high priority for anyone in Vegas anyway, so just a minor gripe!
Also a word of warning that it's not cheap... a bottle of water from a juice bar by the lifts for our hotel cost $5."
691,"All very pricey, so you should expect nothing less than the luxury and service.
Felt a bit ripped off by one of the restaurants at the resort but this is probably not the fault of the hotel, itself."

1459,No coffee in the rooms

1461,Pool was very scummy. Very difficult to navigate inside the hotel. Staff were quite unhelpful when I lost my sunglasses.
1462,The rooms were not cleaned well.
1463,"Very old. For example, Wi-fi which charged me 40 dollars per day was very slow and poor. I couldn't connect to the internet and when I called the IT dept. for help , they told me it was normal. The service was also very poor."
1464,"The restaurants - Tao, Grand Luxe Cafe, Bouchon all served mediocre food which did not live up to the price tag & ambience
The concierge was dreadful.
The Tao Pool party and Tao club were low grade compared to the Wynn"
1465,The only noise we heard was the opening & closing of the doors in the morning. I am not sure if this was staff ( and thus could be changed) or guests ( and as such not able to be changed).
1466,"WE WERE TOLD THAT WE HAD A VEIW OF THE STRIP, SO WE PAID 38.50 A NIGHT FOR THE VEIW. THE ROOM DIDNT HAVE A VEIW SO THEY SWITCH US ONE TIME AND THE SECOND ROOM DIDNT EITHER."
1467,although we chose the upgrade on booking we were offered another on arrival and our room did not have a view of anything other than buidling
1468,Lack of tea and coffee tray in the room.  It was a trek and a half to find where you cold get your daily tea/coffee included in the mandatory $30 a day resort fee.  Why not be more upfront with actual cost of the suite instead of having a n obligatory add on?
1469,"The staff tried to sell an upgrade for rooms making it sound like the booked rooms weren't very good to try and persuade you to spend extra on an upgrade. 
The main pool closed at 6pm even though it was still daylight and really hot. Weren't even allowed to sit on the sun loungers as 'no lifeguard'. The pool on the 10th floor was dirty and smelly and in total shade. 
It's a ridiculously long way from the car park to the reception to check in. Not easy with luggage. 
No tea/ coffee making facilities in the room. Not even a complimentary bottle of water. (The mini bar prices were extortionate!)"
1470,Hallways smelt like an old ashtray on the way to my non-smoking room. You are constantly bothered by vacation property venders and makeup venders while walking thru the hotel shops. That doesn't happen in Caesars. When you say something about the venders the staff at desk simply smiles and says they will pass it along. And remember to read everything when you sign in. There is a resort fee at checkout
1471,I always lose lot of money in blackjack
1472,"We booked a non-smoking room with a view more than two weeks in advance. When we arrived there about 10pm, the recptionist asked us if we wanted a bigger room. We told no, we would like to have the one we booked. Then he changed to a confidential voice and told us that anyways he upgrades us because we stay for two nights and they appreciate this. We were like, well, ok. Then he even questioned us why we are not enthusiastic about his offer. After when he was talking about how great the room is, he mentioned that we can even smoke in it. We said that we want the original room then, because we hate the smell of cigarette, this is why we booked a non-smoking room. This was the point when he revealed why he ""upgraded"" us, to a bigger, but  darker, smelly, smoking room with a view to the parking lot. The room we booked through booking.com two weeks earlier was not available! The next day when we complained they changed to the original suit, which was really nice. Its a shame that we had to have a bad experience for half of our stay for this rate. Moreover they tried to trick us first to buy the upgrade. Moreover the Casino is unbearably smelly because of the smell of cigarette, but you have to go through to get to the rooms and restaurants from the reception. Unfortunatelly in all Hotel casinos we have been to in Nevada  are smoking areas. Therefore we could loose only $10, because we couldn't stay more in the cigarette smoke. :) A separated, closed area would be needed for smokers."
1473,After I get back to my room at night nearly 9 pm I found the room not clean. I called them three times during two hours to send someone to clean my room and every time they say in their way then wait a while at the end she answered my call saying they closed your request then directly my response was do not send anyone I want to sleep.
1474,The hotel was like a giant maze! The layout is horrible.  I had to take 3 elevators just to get to my room from valet. There is no direct path to the floors. It took 2 days to learn our way back and forth to the car.  It made us not want to leave the room. :-( .
1475,Door seemed thin and could hear everything from the corridoor.
1476,The eateries around the casino were not in keeping with the quality of the hotel - a bit 'fast food' which was a shame.
1477,Extremely loud people in the hallway. Not the hotels fault.
1478,Internet in the hotel room did not work. Spent an hour on the phone with a rep from the hotel with no resolve and spent 4 days without the promised included wifi access. Toilet broke on the second day there and took an entire day for someone to come and fix it.
1479,"the valet took the car from the front and parked it. in the process he put a big 8"" scrape of yellow paint above the rear driver side wheel. it was a rental car.... i'll never let the valet at any place take my car again. the last two valet parking jobs in two hotel stays (in different states) have resulted in real problems."
1480,"The noise from Tao beach pool with the base and volume far too loud.  If you were sunbathing by the pool next door, it was overpowering."
1481,The resort fee was a bit surprising to us and only knew of this when we arrived at the location.  Finding our room was a challenge but then this is a large facility.
1482,"Restaurants were expensive; we didn't like being hounded by touts in the grand canal area and hotel lobby, trying to get us to visit a time-share or selling trips etc; the smell of smoke was evident both in the casino and in the corridors of the guest bedrooms, which was a little off-putting."
1483,Nothing at all!
1484,"My wife and I were spending out 10 year anniversary at the Venetian. Upon checking in they did the usual update to try and get us to upgrade. The woman at the counter spoke very quickly and it was very loud with the number of people around. She said ""would you like to upgrade your room to a strip view for 45?"" I asked my wife and she really didn't want to, I asked the woman ""just 45?"" she said ""yes"". I figured well for 45 bucks why not we are on our anniversary.   They give me the form and asked ""sign there"". 
We get up to our room and what did we get for our ""strip view?"" We see the swimming pool, treasure island and the back side of the Palazzo. If you got near the glass and looked to the side you could see the strip. Again my wife was wanting to get our original room. I was still like hey we only paid 45 dollars. 
It was not till we left to see they charged us 50 dollars a night. After speaking with Thomas the manager what is their response? ""Well you signed the registration card"". It appears their staff who is checking you in are trained to not give you all the information because we double checked with ours and then get you to sign quickly because once you do your screwed. We have stayed at more than one hotel in Vegas and this is the first time we have been screwed over like this. 
Maybe this is a live and learn experience but no other hotel has done this they have all been upfront or didn't attempt to up sell. If you do decide to stay here make them explain everything in detail. I would recommend the MGM Grand over the Venetian. Maybe not as fancy looking inside but much better value for your money, just as comfortable beds and have never tried to use tricky up sale tricks."
1485,"Service very poor. No housekeeping one night, no replacement toiletries or towels another night. No attention to guest services which is what i expect for the money. Would not recommend it. Very disappointing"
1486,"Check your bill at the check out!! I have unjustified charges on my statements and no one can justify why or what I have been charged for. 4 weeks after check out this matter is still on going.
Very disappointed to end such a nice experience on a bad note."
1487,The view from the room was a brick wall. And there was a mix up when we checked in whereby the total amount was taken off my debit card which I thought they wanted for ID. I was then told the money wouldn't go back into my account for 7 working days but at this point I had already paid (again) on credit card. Staff were not apologetic at all and I felt like it wasn't explained. It was a lot of money taken at the start of a 6 day trip!
1488,"View was of back/employee entrance (guessing this is why the curtain didn't even open). Big tub, but no jets!"
1489,The Tao pool party music was way too heavy with the same set both days we visited.
1490,"The view was the parking garage wall and other facilities ugliness. That was disappointing. 
It would be so nice to be able to have a cup of coffee in the room (without ordering room service). Great options to get coffee and tea downstairs but you have to be dressed and rolling. ."
1491,"We had a very bad experience there. When we checked in, they didn't clean the room completely. Also the window is broken, it couldn't block the wind. We waste a lot of time for communicating with hotel."
1492,Smoking was allowed in the casino and tables!
1493,"Very expensive,charged extra 45 per night for view which was poor and another 35 per night for amenities such as with fi which again was very poor"
1494,Hard to find our way around the hotel at times due to sheer size
1495,"I didnt like that the windows are not open-able which makes a very funny smell in the rooms and on the corridors. Its a huge building with no access to fresh air, except the ventilation and re-circulation of the air. In some rooms you can feel a strong smell of humidity and mold.
In the building everywhere it is very very cold.
The ventilation system from the room is either very cold or hot and dry, which makes uncomfortable staying and sleeping in the room.
Although in the bath there is tube and shower, none of them have a flexible long hose for the shower. The shower cabin has fix shower nozzle very uncomfortable to wash on lower parts of the body and always have to wear a cap not to wet your hair. 
3 days in row we didnt have enough towels in the bath and we had to ask every time. The same for sleepers.
This is a mass hotel (more than 3000 rooms)and definitely the services (including room supply and cleaning) cannot be at 5 star hotel level.
The hotel can be visited at any level rooms, pool, restaurants, casinos, shops, by anybody at any moment so it is not need to stay in this hotel and pay the high."
1496,"The uncourtious staff, the understaffed hotel (it took 20 minutes for front desk to pick a call), basics like tea, coffee, access to pool, steam and sauna were available to hotel guests at a steep additional cost. Nobody cared to do anything for a complaint against housekeeping and the thermometer I asked for after falling sick costed me 31 USD."
1497,"I didn't like that you couldn't use the refrigerator. It is packed with minibar stuff, which are connected to sensors that once you move the items, you are charged automatically."
1498,Ringing our door bell at 8:52 AM on day of check out to ask me when I want my room cleaned! The first rule of the hospitality business is to make your guests feel welcome. Read that again.
1499,The room and hallway still smell of smoke which requested non smoking. The walls were thin to hear other guestd. Ice bucket too small. Parking and valet confusing to go which hotel. Pools were cold never warmed up.
1500,"Pool was not that impressive especially Tao beach. Went through a lot of security scrutiny for a whole lot of nothing on the other side. Crowded, no seats and small jacuzzi size pool. Expected a lot better."
1501,"Staff at check in not very helpful and even when we checked out they did not even ask of everything was ok with our stay. 
They were more interested taking the charges for the room."
1502,No coffee service in the rooms.  Long walk to exit the hotel.  Mini bar charges for picking up the items and no sign letting you know.
1503,Tried charging wrong mini bar consumptions. Beware of putting your stuff in the mini firdge since the system automatically understands you had something from the mini bar.
1504,"We were very disappointed with the service at Bouchon. It was my wife's birthday I made reservations well in advance, and we were not spoken to for 20-25 minutes. We ended up walking out."
1505,It's a little hard to navigate as it is so large.
1506,"...chewed/dried chewing gum stuck onto one of the painting on the bathroom wall is unacceptable...
One of the front desk staff at the spa was not helpful"
1507,Accidently selected a movie and came straight out of it but was still billed $18.99 which I thought was a bit unfair but apart from that no other issues.
1508,For a 5 star hotel the wifi wasn't great at all.could do with a boost.
1509,The wifi sucks from the rooms and don't pick up anything from the minibar (otherwise you'll get charged) we disputed this and they took it off the bill
1510,"Not sure how much tips is acceptable for cleaning the room. One of our rooms even was remained same and only move the tips we left. Totally lost and upset...
But the hotel is quite good. And Casino too...
Room is the exactlly same as what is shown on the pics!"
1511,"There was a ball of hair on the new towels that were given to me, they're controller and alarm clock were broken and I had to ask for another one, they take too long to tend to your request, and last but not the least they over charged me by almost 300$!!!"
1512,"the carpets were dirty - not enough towels - someone left their clothes in some of the drawers - there was a cigarette left by one of the cleaning ladies (I guess she forgot it in the bathroom) - I had to call to get a plunger because the toilette was clogged - One of the TVs had pretty much NO HD channels. Tough to believe these days especially in one of THESE hotels - When I checked in, the lady who was taking care of me offered me another room (double the size she said). I asked how much more? She said, ""Three hundred more dollars per night but I can get it for you at half the price"". I don't find this very professional. Naturally, I declined. - Difficult to find someone to help when you get lost in the maze, but that's more on me than on you. i guess the signs are not as good as they should, but again, this one is on me"
1513,"The bathroom, although big and beautiful had a problem with the hot water. The only way to get hot water in the shower was to let hot water run from the sink as well. Also, after having a bath, I emptied the bathtub to realise that the water from my bath was coming up through the shower's floor and bringing with it all the dirt stuck in the pipes (lots of very black dirt). This hotel has a plumbing problems that need to be solved. They did however reimburse us the hotel fee for the inconvenience."
1514,"We ate in Lavo restaurant which was very over priced. The music was so loud I couldnt hear the person on the otherside of the table. We ordered four dishes, all of which came with the same sauce. For over $120 per person we expected better. Service was fine however."
1515,"Don't touch the mini bar even if you touch you are charged, it is not important to consume everything works on weight sensors you touch the weight shifts and you are charged."
1516,No Comment.. That says it all.
1517,It would be nice if the hotel supplied a map when you check in so you can find the restaurants and Venice replicas.
1518,"Trashy people would leave their nasty party detritus (takeout, boxes of beer bottles, Etc) outside their rooms and it would sit there overnight or longer.  I was in 18 322, so that wing.
One night some party people appeared to be having an argument and I had to listen to some woman screeching for an hour. I called down but was put on hold after someone said they would transfer me to security. So I got impatient and hung up and just put a pillow over my head.
Could Las Vegas be any more ridiculous with the smoking indoors? Like come on you guys. It's 2016. I was in a non-smoking room and my floor smelled like smoke 100% of the time. You cannot escape the cigarettes. Except maybe in the convention center and the nicer areas of the fake Italy area. Being inside for a week for a conference with that smell was horrible, especially with a cold. And I smoked for 10 years."
1519,Unfortunately too much smoking in the casino. Air con could be improved to make it a pleasant experience for everyone.
1520,"The room should have a coffee maker and daily bottled water. We notified them we were there to get married, but there was no special arrangement or upgrade offered. In fact, we were told there were no suites available as we had booked."
1521,"No in room coffee maker. Casino area had more smoke than was comfortable. It was better than older hotels but not as good as some of the newer ones like Aria. Thankfully, you can bypass the casino for everything but front desk access."
1522,"Our bathroom shower had clump of hair inside,tells me not cleaned at all....clean bathroom is very important to us😞"
1523,Not a lot a shop variety within the hotel shops. No microwave or refrigerator for guests was a bit disappointing being the price of rooms.
1524,Answered above.
1525,"If you pull a drink to look at, then put it back in fridge, you will be charged. My crazy friends were checking the drinks and later I saw more than $100 on my bill. The staff nicely removed the charges with no foss!"
1526,Not all employees were terribly friendly. We had some interactions with smart-ass (borderline rude) security people in the hallways.
1527,"Being 'British' and someone who likes their own tea first thing in the morning, or even at any other time of the day, tea and coffee making facilities would be good. I realise we are there to 'spend', which we did, but having to leave the lovely room in search of hot water at 4.00am is a nuisance!"
1528,"I don't like the idea that they try to sell you a different room as you check in, first it was the same type of room with a better view for $45 more per night, then it was a suite with external balcony for $150 more per night.
Due to the size of the complex, finding the actual room in the Palazzo tower was complicated."
1529,"For the 5 stars hotel it is very shame there are no free mineral water, no mini refrigerator and water heater in the room.."
1530,"Upon check-in I discovered my wallet missing.
The front desk clerk's reaction was to move to the side and get out of the way.  No sympathy or suggestions whatsoever."
1531,Explanation of amenities and things offered at hotel during check in was not good. Maze to find room. Prices of in room items are extremely inflated. Some increase understandable. But current prices ridiculous.
1532,"Service is available, but you need to ask for it (no turn down etc)."
1533,We have never stayed at a hotel where they don't accommodate free champagne or wine glasses.
1534,"Be careful of the additional tax that is not enclosed in the price, €30 per day per room."
1535,Cocktail waitresses were rude and unattentive when drinks were ordered
1536,There's not one thing I didn't like about The Venetian Hotel. Hospitality was the best and customer service was excellent. I've stayed at other hotels in Vegas and The Venetian Hotel and Casino is by far my favorite!!!
1537,"Bad luck at the casino!  Did'nt win! 
But ..."
1538,"Would prefer a coffee maker in the room as well as some.room.in the fridge for our own items.
Difficult to find an outside seating area.  The pool was crowded and we would have liked to relax near the pool and had a drink without actually being a swimmer...maybe we missed something but that type of area was not easy to find."
1539,"At times the smoke from the casino area overwhelming, especially to non=smokers like us"
1540,Cigarette smoke in casino is really bad compared to other hotels on the strip we stayed at. Gondola ride is overpriced and we ended up not doing it.
1541,I have a baby and I can't believe I had to pay a fee for a water heater. I also had to request tooth brush and sleepers. It should be provided in the hotel room so people do not need to call to request them
1542,Maybe only the long walk through the smokey casino to take your luggage to the tower lift.
1543,"Even so the facilities in the Spa and the massage was outstanding the price was outrageous.
Also that you have to leave the Pool Aria by 5 pm is something I never heard of. Not cool
Oh.. And there is no coffee or tea maker in the room. Who wants to dress first before a cup of Java. Not 4 1/2 Star service for me and I always stay in Hotels with at least 4 Stars"
1544,The room wasn't completely cleaned. There was a towel soaked in the bath tub when we went to the room. I had to call the cleaning service for cleaning the bath tub. It was incredible for such a big 5-star hotel.
1545,"Upgraded for more money for a view of the strip,but the view wasn't good back on location of Venezia tower.
Hate it when you touch something  in minibar causing a false fee. No coffee on room."
1546,"The rooms were very noisy.  The walls are thin and you can hear people in the halls all night.
All of the restaurants at the hotel were very expensive and not very great quality."
1547,"Housekeeping failed to clean and make up our room two days in a row. We had to call guest services. We were out most of the day and did not have a ""Do Not Disturb"". They just missed our room."
1548,The wifi was very slow and frustrating. Difficult to get work done in this situation.
1549,"We booked a luxury king suite with a view and paid in full ahead of time. When we arrived, we were informed that only smoking rooms were available unless we paid to upgrade to a different suite. We paid to upgrade but the room we received was more of a conference room type suite and not really good for a couple just wanting to stay and have a view. The bed pulled out of the wall and was small. I was really disappointed in the entire process. We should not have to pay anything extra."
1550,"Hotel can not  provided water  you can purchase 500ml @5 usd 
No tea cattel in room it is also chargeable 10 usd 
Rooms are old. 
Many other  Good hotels options in Vegas"
1551,schedule of cleaning room was a little inconsistent ---but that is nit-picking
1552,"I checked in quite early but was told my room was ready. When I arrive at my room, there was a ""do nOt disturb"" sign hanging on the door knob and i brought to the attention of the cleaning lady. The room has not been cleaned and the my card later did not even work"
1553,"Restaurants offered slow poor service. Some of the staff had bad attitude. Our suite was not cleaned properly leaving used  glasses, bins etc not cleaned up. Brick wall for view from suite. Very disapointed."
1554,"It is so expansive, you can easily get lost and parking is so far from the rooms"
1555,Food server in Noodle Asia Restaurant in Veneitian kept my drivers license and I didn't know it until I arrived at airport next day. The restaurant had my room number but never contacted me to tell me.
1556,Service from some of the staff was sorely lacking. We had no snacks in our room and asked for 2 days but still not forthcoming. Few problems with the billing and ended up with credit applied
1557,"There was no coffee maker in the room. Also i ordered a drink to the which was suppose to take 30 min, after 1.5 hours i had to call and cancel the drink. They didnt even appologize for the delay! The internet access was cut-off directly after check-out although it was before 11. I thought the whole stay was unpersonal and was really disappointed with the room service."
1558,"Aging facilities, poor signage, many correctable flaws (elevators don't ping upon arrival, nor do the indicator lights work, TV slow, minibar uses sensors to charge. . .)"
1559,"Missing a coffee machine and a fridge to put my own stuff, the fridge was filled with hotel bottles that could not be moved without pay."
1560,It takes forever to find the reception and to move around but this is the establishment of such hotels. One just has to have this in mind.
1561,Misinformation on tour and attraction information. Staff was very courteous but needs to brush up on current information to avoid needless confusion and delays.
1562,"The cleanliness of the room was questionable for the standard of hotel it classes itself as. Also room maintenance should be taken care of. We had a glass shower door that was sticking and each time you opened or shut it I thought the glass would break. 
Also for the standard of room we booked I would of thought breakfast would of been included."
1563,"i left my louis vuitton scarf in the closet and the lost and found department told me they did not see it. However, I do sure I left the scarf in the closet."
1564,Food and drinks were expensive. It would have been great to have a coffee maker in the room.
1565,Having to leave!
1566,We had room 9546 and the smell of cigarette smoke was so overwhelming in our corridor that we requested a swap and got 14312 which was OK and far more accessible. After 4 nights we still found it confusing to find our way around this enormously big hotel. Sorry we will not stay there again.
1567,"A non-smoking room is only a 'request', and upon arrival we were told there were none available. We were then asked to pay for an upgrade we didn't want otherwise we would have to sleep in a smoking room. Incredible."
1568,"Had a mishap with a bottle of champagne that was ordered for my 21st via my brother in Australia, staff were hopeless in tracking this down until I requested to speak to a manager and there was no apologies just sent the bottle up like they didn't care at all."
1569,the long walk from the car park to the reception. There should be some instructions on how to get to the reception from carpark park
1570,Day of departure Called front desk requested a luggage rack we waited 45 minutes and then decided to take all of our luggage down by ourselves which was not easy due to how far we had to carry all of our bags. There also was a clock that goes off every hour on the hour and chimes to each hour for the time of day that was annoying so loud.
1571,Sound proofing of room was poor. Gap under door to hall meant we could hear people coming down the hallway. We also had a door into next room (which was locked) but we could hear their TV.
1572,I wouldn't recommend this hotel for families like ours with young children (9 months). The rooms are really far from everything and the hotel layout was really confusing! My little one needed to go down for bed and we got lost for almost half an hour! And no I was not drinking! It is a great hotel just plan accordingly.
1573,"I hated that I had to go downstairs and pay $3.00 every time I wanted a cup of coffee.
We would have liked to have our room cleaned earlier in the day."
1574,My stay could have been longer. There wasn't anything I didn't like about my stay at the Venetian.
1575,"Reception staff were very rude when I spkoe with them in many times (check in and check out) 
At least she should ask me how was your stay with us when I'm leaving!! She just gave me the bill and looked behind me to see other guest. 
I stayed for a weekend in the hotel, and no one came to clean my room or even changed the towels, even they came in early morning they should keep a paper saying that we came but there was don't disturb sign or even coming later. I left that day from the room at 12pm and I asked the woman to clean my suite but she didn't. 
One more thing, the room does not have coffee maker or boiling machine or any kinds of hot drinks? That's strange! And when I asked the help desk why you don't do this? She said just like that we don't do it? So rude !!!"
1576,"We asked for a room for non-smoking, however, the moment we walked in the room you could smell smoke.  It got really bad on some occasions (one time with the smell of weed) and we ended up running the ac as that made it better.  Pretty disappointing.  We also found that despite being on the strip, it isn't as central as some of the newer hotels and we wouldn't stay there again and would get somewhere close to the middle of the strip next time."
1577,"at booking they showed the price at 159.00 I booked it and didn't think on adding up you guys charged me at 169.00at least you should say the price changed and let me make a deciscion for myself ,any way I am satisfied"
1578,"The room was not being cleaned properly, we were having crumbs we left on the first day for the whole our stay; there was not a nice smell of food in the room when we arrived which remained for quite a long time; be VERY careful with the mini bar!!! it's on sensors everywhere which means every take out of the bottle/etc. or even touch will cause automatic charge of your room. Check your bill at check-out in details and ask them to remove unconsumed items and other things you didn't use or already included in the room rate."
1579,"View is limited from my room. Door of my room is not sound-proved. The hotel charges for almost everything including the kettle, which we need for our little baby. No play area for little kids."
1580,The staff on the outside was very rude to me and my husband. They did not help me with my bags or valet. But the desk manager made sure we were taken care of after I told them what happened.
1581,"The concierge to pick up our bag on departure took over an hour, despite being told it would only be 20 minutes. We would rather have carried them down ourselves."
1582,I had to get a new key card three times during my visit and almost every pool was closed. I would have thought with a resort fee of $30 a day all the pools would have been open.
1583,Why on earth can a five star hotel expecting 4 people in a room leaves only 1 shampoo!!! And forget asking for more because judging the mile long corridors it should take an hour to arrive more...
1584,They have really soft pillows on the bed which makes my neck stiff because I'm use to form pillows.
1585,more than a little walk in cold weather to other attractions on the strip like Ballagio fountains etc
1586,Cannot think of anything we didnt like!
1587,"You are pretty much a number not a guest. The welcome is OK, but a little robotic as the check in staff just work through the usual questions and hardly smile. It must be a boring job. The décor in the room was tired, with some chips off the furniture, but I am being picky!"
1588,"Overpriced and over the top decor. Reception staff obviously told to be nice, were bordering patronizing.  I like when staff is attentive, but it was too forced and fake."
1589,Even though we had booked 2 stripe view rooms they changed them last minute no reason!! The room they gave us smelt of smoke!!
1590,"Coffee machine in the Room would be better 
And information on room credits is little or absent Any such information published would make it easier to understand"
1591,"The less amenities, no slippers, no water boilers, no hairdryers,  the somber colors in the rooms."
1592,"Housekeeping didn't understand English when we asked for more towels. They never arrived. The front desk tried to ""excuse"" them. I alerted them twice that I was allergic to down and feathers. Found down pillows in my room!!!!  I had a reaction and VERY BAD EXPERIENCE. That should have NEVER happened."
1593,Room had just one towel and no shampoo or conditioner. Someone took snacks that appeared on the bill. This however was reversed at the checkout desk.
1594,We had couple of issues with the cleaning of the room. Wasn't really what i expect from the five star hotel.
1595,May be a small complaint but the toilet paper and tissues in the suites was of poor quality. A high end hotel should think of everything!
1596,I wish the tub had jets 🙁
1597,I would  have like a little more information about the hotel itself as far as what was available and also the connection  between the Venetian and the Palazzo hotel.  Are they one in the same? Also their Grazie program at the casino- wish they  would have explained that at check in.
1598,"Would have been nicer if the hotel/casino was smoke free and if there weren't as many ""vultures"" offering free shows or discount prices if you agree to go to a timeshare meeting for 90+ minutes"
1599,"Shops cater only to people who wants to spend tons of money.Also,since I
play only on poker slot machines,you have only few of those,which were
taken almost all the time."
1600,Wish they had a kettle in the room.
1601,"Having some many guests, if you want to check in/out or go upstairs at the same time than large groups of people (e.g. convention ends), you will have to wait. Being so large it means that you have to leave your room 15 minutes in advance to reach the exit."
1602,"- room rate + tax, resort fee (what's that!?) + tax; bar items charged after unintentional touching them + tax etc. etc. + tax! ;)
count on up to double final sum charged to you (in comparison to the one you've seen when reservation had been made).
- don't touch anything in (and on) the bar physically (even if you search for TV remote control around ;) - it's charged automatically
- luxury bathroom with NO flexible shower set and/or bidet"
1603,"The rooms were big but didn't feel particularly inviting. The lighting was harsh, and we had a bad view out the back of the building. There are no coffee making facilities in the room."
1604,the price for a tea and juice to be brought to the room was astronomical! There was an old drink bottle rubbish under the chair. I was wearing a full length gown so needed a full length mirror - none was in the room and the hotel did not have one to bring to the room. For a city known for weddings and a hotel that has a wedding service that is pretty bad.
1605,I didnt like this hotel casino area. Very crowded and not organised. Also in the rooms floor many plates was put outside no one was collecting them for a day or even more.
1606,Nothing really. We had to wait for our trolley quite a bit during our check out but since we were leaving Dec 30th and the whole Las Vegas became a madhouse we don't want to complain about that. The guy coming at last was really helpful and sweet and made up for the wait.
1607,"Just a couple of comments - not meant to detract from a very nice hotel:
Labyrinth of hallways hard to navigate.
Italian architecture and decor, so seems strange that nothing Italian about the staff whatsoever."
1608,the wifi is terrible from our room it s more none existent...they send the IT guy...still the same....and we can not change rooms... my daughter is cranky because we can not get access to internet
1609,"I think the discount price was good, however if i had to pay the original price i think the room was a little small to what i was expecting, and also the picture of the room at the website was looking way better than what it actually is. Another big issue was the toilet paper, the last day of my stay i did not have toilet paper, even i think i didnt get towels' replacement . Overall for the price i paid for the room it was fine, but for the original price i think needs a little more improvement. Lastly one thing i disliked about the hotel service was that they tried to add extra charges to my room bill, when i didnt even made those charges, even though at the end they removed it from my bill, it was very unconfortable, time consuming, frustrating and inconvenient to be calling for that kind of matter."
1610,The expensive price because of holiday season
1611,Only negatives were that the casino was a little congested and it was sometimes difficult to get drinks while gambling in the casino.
1612,Every time we asked the staff a basic question like do you know where we could find Gelato they didn't know. We asked about 4 people. There was also a lady at the Gondola ride who was very short and rude. Quite frankly shouldn't work with the public.
1613,"The room I stayed in was not renovated and ""old."" I was
staying on the side where it is closer to the front desk/main
entrance of the hotel. Upon checking in and using the bathroom of the
room, the metal holder that holds the toilet paper was barely dangling.
It completely fell apart and came off the wall after trying to use the
toilet paper. Everything about the room just felt ""old"" and
outdated. I usually stay on the side where it's closer to the
casino, which is renovated and beautiful. I found out that if you book
through a third party like booking.com or trip advisor, you are stuck
staying in the side where I was staying--which is the old and not
renovated side.
For the price I paid, I didn't think it was worth the money to stay on the NOT renovated and old side of the hotel property."
1614,Nothing.
1615,"Every staff is fine, just one exception. The security guard at the
Venetian tower treated me very bad. I was following my family, and the
security guard was asking me to show him the room key. My father showed
it but the guard asked my key also. I told him this is my father. He
replied, I don't know who is your father. And I grabbed my
father's key and presented it to him angrily, because of his
unreasonable request. He was getting crazy and yelled at me. I don't
understand the language he was using but I am pretty sure that he did
not say any good word. He standed so close to me and his saliva was
splashed on my face. I feel scared and I am threatened. I told him stay
away from me and I said I will complain this. He threatened me. This
thing was happened on 30th December 2015 around 11pm. If the hotel saw
this, please check the cctv, I am pretty sure that was an ugly scene.
Please contact me if the Venetian wants know any details."
1616,"It was a hike to get to our rooms.  If we didn't have a map, I'm not sure we would have found it."
1617,"The hotel is quite expensive, so they could at least have offered a coffee machine and a bottle of water for free. Instead we got some coupons for coffee and a paper. And anyway had to pay extra, since it only included regular coffee - not latte. And we couldn't even touch anything in the mini bar without getting charged. Check in took ages and was a bit ""messy""."
1618,Better view as requested would have been good.  Had to settle for a view overlooking the pool and not the strip. It would also be nice to have a little extra room in the mini bar for our own items along with a coffee pot or hot water heater for tea.
1619,No room service that could be used. We were told that it would take 1:30 to 2:00 hrs to send up our order :(
1620,"The room was not as clean as I would expect from a property of your history.  when we arrived, dead flowers in trash, Victoria Secret clothing label on floor, dirty towel in bath.  Honestly, it looked like someone had met up in the room for a hookup prior to our check in.  Have you ever had a problem with this in the past?"
1621,"The smoke within the casino is a real turnoff. Couldn't spend much time in the casino but every casino has exactly the same criticism,"
1622,At check in they charged 48 usd per night to make sure we had a strip view. The view was worthless unlike other hotels in Vegas.
1623,I paid about 5 dollars more than the price you mentioned! Some staff could not give us the service they gave to other customers like us!
1624,"Only downside and no fault of the hotel as it is a separate chain but is within the hotel but the Palazzo size, but the restaurant carnevino was a real let down the food was very expensive, burnt and was awful (we had a better steak meal at the outback and for a small fraction of the price) this is the only thing I would avoid."
1625,"A lot of walking to get to the room,  have to walk through the casino with all your suitcases just to get to your room. Alot of walking just to get out of the hotel. Toilet needs to be separated from bathroom not ideal to have in the bathroom."
1626,"Every other service is quite expensive. Long line on check-in. Don't move the drinks out of the fridge, otherwise you're gonna be charged. The hotel doesn't have the exclusive feeling - it is nice but huge, so don't expect that the staff will threat you like you are the only one guest :)"
1627,"Very unfriendly stuff, hidden charges, hard mattress, dirty bath tub, and room was not worth the money we paid."
1628,"Need some firmer pillows.
Bar Fridge with automatic billing. We used to put our food in and ended up having to go down to front desk to straighten out bill."
1629,Very very smoky in the casino which permeates throughout the building.  Too many kids in strollers all strolling through the casino.
1630,"No coffee maker in room, no indoor pool, breakfast not included in suite rent."
1631,"I arrived with sensitive equipment and luggage that I did not want moved by someone else to my room. Unfortunately, this meant I could not use a luggage cart. It was humiliating having to drag the equipment across the casino floor to the elevator banks a tenth of a mile away. I explained to the staff in the carport and they laughed and said ""that's how it's done here.""  It's a shame, I loved the place but I won't take my employees here again after that.   It made me feel like human cattle."
1632,The smoking room was very very smelly. I think they should do something about it as i've stayed in smoking rooms before but this was too smelly.
1633,"We booked a suite on a higher floor but there were only smoking suites available, so they moved us to the Palazzo tower. But the suites are similar"
1634,"Casino level is quite smokey but I think they're all like that, nice having the Shops and restaurants on separate floor - family loved it."
1635,"The service is terrible, they lost my luggages, and the clean lady kocked my room at 6 am, very rude, she did not even say sorry because she woke my baby up!
Very disappointed about this hotel!"
1636,A bit on the expensive side. The room was only set up for two even though they knew there was three of us and they wanted us to pay for extra wine glass .The safe in the room was not working man came to fix it but it broke next day. Another man came and fixed it. He said it was the batteries either not working or not put in right.
1637,"Mattress and seats would need to be renewed.
No coffee machine in the suite."
1638,"I did not like the fact that my room was so far to get to.  After 3 days, that was ridiculous to have to take two elevators.  That will be the one reason we stay at another hotel."
1639,"I stayed at the Venetian last year (December 2014) it was way more better than this year (December 2015);
1- the room was dirty: hairs in the bed, white derbies on the night stands and the tables
2- when I complained, I did not hear the word ""sorry for any inconvenience""b
3- I asked for a room switch, after about an hour they switched!!
4- the new room was dirty too!!! I sled them to clean it, I was so tired to wait in the lobby for a new room to be emptied and cleaned
I don't think I'm going to stay here again"
1640,"Nothing only a minor thing, no fridge in room"
1641,The bathroom doors did not lock and the check in lady was sorta rude.
1642,I felt the room was a little over priced for what you got.
1643,"we were booked for 1 king bed suite and they deducted the first night's price two months in advance, still when we got there they said only queen bed is available and kings were all booked."
1644,With no expense spared I would think they would have an updated clock radio and in room sound system of some sort.
1645,"Had to walk through very smoky casino to get to our guest elevators, our
(including child) hair and clothing smelled like smoke our entire stay.
Every interaction with emplyees was either fair or poor, but no
exceptional service. No free WiFi, terrible reception in hotel rooms,
lame tv channels, very very expensive room service ($24 for a pot of
coffee?!). Hotel was chaotic, no valet available to returning guests
(only available at registration), parking was a pain, bellman took
forever. Room decor felt very outdated and old person. Lacking anything
special/no vibe/feel."
1646,"Bathroom shower fills up with water when draining tub.  Toilet runs every once in a while - needs fixing.  Asked for a quiet room, ended up above the air conditioning units, fortunately the sound was not too loud.  Some of the Gracie employees need more training."
1647,"As soon as I arrived there was no one to help me with my bags, it was not until I was at check in did someone come to help at the request of the front desk. Front desk on check staff was ok and check out was very friendly but did not have an answer to a query I had regarding bill which was odd."
1648,"The luxurious down quilt on the bed was uncomfortable (too hot, too heavy)."
1649,Wish they had a fridge that we can store our stuff and microwave in the rooms. As well as better quality toilet paper because for a 5 star hotel they use the cheapest toilet paper ever.
1650,Keys didn't work properly first time and was told it would take 15 minutes for security to get to us. Cleaning crew was able to help us out quicker - apparently lock was tricky/dirty.  New keys solved the issue the rest of the trip.
1651,Nothing
1652,"For such expensive hotel, there was not a coffee maker machine in the suite. The room was not cleaned properly, was not vacuumed for 3 days!!!  Not enough towels and toiletries provided."
1653,"Water pressure was not poor but definitely not great either.  We are non-smokers so to us the entire strip smelled like an ash tray.  Even though they are suppose to be a non-smoking facility, you can smoke in all common areas."
1654,"Shower was terrible
There was hotel filtered water that we were charged 2 x$5 for.  This water looked complementary....we discovered at check out it wasnt.
Becoming a little dated"
1655,Had to walk long distance from parking to room. Had to take multiple elevator. Not allowed to leave children by them self walking Around
1656,"The hotel was built in phases and now the suites feel like an after thought to a non-existent master plan.  As someone who has traveled extensively all over the world, I found the hotel layout to be the most disjointed facility I've ever seen - and there would appear to be no way to fix the problem."
1657,"So big, unable to see everything and Vegas itself in 2 days. Almost too posh !"
1658,The cleaning team can improve their timing to clean the room. They usual come in too early (like 8-9am) or too late (3pm onwards) as these are the usual time that people will be in their room.
1659,"Don't like paying for the exorbitant resort fee, and $18 for a movie
that I didn't like or watch. Would like a refund on both. My room
the second night was nearly $600!"
1660,"No tea or coffee making facilities in room.
Large hotel, walking distances can be a challenge or annoying for some.
Resort fees are expensive for what you get."
1661,"The bed was not comfortable  also the pillows 
  For A room Considered a luxury it's not luxury."
1662,"I would like big and easier maps. It should show all the short cuts. Walking around is fun at first, but when you want to get somewhere you want the shortest way. We found some, but we would have like to be able to find them with out searching or accidentally finding them."
1663,"The bad experience is generalized throughout Vegas, although less so in the newer hotels such as Cosmopolitan. The smoke in the casino kept us from gambling and caused us to find alternative routes. We have been to Vegas perhaps 8 times, but this will be our last because of the smoke."
1664,"Food was very pricey and really NOT good. Avoid the food hall in the hotel if you can. But then again, it's hard to find decent food anywhere in Las Vegas..."
1665,It took us a while to figure out how to get around in the hotel to avoid walking through the smoky casino. It would have been nice to have an in-room coffee machine.
1666,Not to be particular but their performers on the St. Mark Square were all so absentminded. No one was really trying. A big killjoy. Many at the hotel just always seemed so exhausted
1667,"The bathroom sink gurgled constantly, and there were small children everywhere!"
1668,"The kiosks trying to sell you timeshares or whatever, not hotel staff, but how can this hotel allow those very  pushy people to interrupt your walk right in front of the guest elevators???"
1669,"I did not like the fact that there is not a coffee maker in the room, although our door key did entitle us to two free cups of coffee per day from a coffee bar close to the convention facilities(which we were not attending)."
1670,Curtains were not working and also in shower the water was not v hot and force of the water was not good.
1671,I was disappointed there was no coffee pot in the suite for which I paid nearly $300. Then when I ordered a pot of tea I was told by one worker that it would be 30 mins. After waiting for an hour I called back but was rudely told by another worker that the previous worker who took my order put it down as 40 mins but also that the coffee makers were all taken up. Then she called back and said she found one and will get the tea shortly but I cancelled the order since we were getting late. Pathetic excuse and service for a 5 star hotel.
1672,"No tea and coffee facilities in the room - apparently due to the fire hazard they posed, and yet there were four plug sockets next to the sinks?!!"
1673,Very heavy touting from shops which we found unpleasant and uncomfortable.  We would have been inclined to browse and shop more without this.
1674,Did not have a complimentary breakfast as booked through Booking.com. Book direct to receive it. Ask for a room with a view.
1675,"The hotel signage to the adjacent Sands expo which is where the conference I was attending was held was rather confusing, and seemed to point in all different directions, no doubt to let people wander all round the casino floor, but it was just plain annoying until I figured the route out; even the fast food places on site are expensive (but what the hell). The toiletries in the room were of surprisingly low quality (but packaged nicely); room service were efficient and helpful."
1676,"We booked a non-smoking room for 2 nights. When we arrived we were given
a smoking room. Were told they could not move us until the next day.
Gave us an air-purifier but this did not make enough difference to the
air quality. Made us feel very unwell.
Have sent a complaint direct to the hotel 11 days ago - have not heard back."
1677,"This hotel is massive - we had to use the hotel map for our two day stay. The staff were very helpful on check in/check out and also the information provided by the concierge, but somehow it seemed to lack the personal touch - probably because it is so big and so busy."
1678,"Price is outrageous
Went when city was blocked off for marathon and concert. The City did not plan the amount of inconvenience it created. Traffic was an absolute nightmare and hotel was not prepared to accomodate with any help to get our luggage. We had to park many blocks away and checked in with no luggage. Warnings should have been posted on website or prices should have been significantly reduced. I booked and paid for upper floor king room with a view. 16th floor is not upper floor. Feel I was ripped off. The room and dinner was excellent but with everything considered. Paying over $700 qualifies me as an idiot."
1679,Concierge front desk was a bit rude when asked to print out boarding passes upon departure.  Acted like I was such a burden. I had actually called in advance so I could simply pick up on my way out.
1680,Really needs a coffee maker in room.  So expensive also.   No need for a resort fee.
1681,"- View from room 
- Noise from corridor"
1682,The staff in the casino weren't helpful at all and where condescending to the point that we   wanted to leave to play at another casino. Security on the other hand was very nice and helpful
1683,Parking and valet is it as friendly or well laid out as the palazzo
1684,nothing
1685,Price was more than specified at booking.com - was added tax and resort fee. I would suggest to be more accurate for booking.con when calculating room price.
1686,Small thing waking up in the morning and no tea or coffee in the room
1687,"The amount of people on the gaming floor was crazy and there was no let up, and the positioning of the gambling units were crammed in. The hotel was cold due to the air conditioning system and this made it very uncomfortable. We visited other hotels on the strip and the gaming floors were a lot more relaxed, the ambient temperature was comfortable and I would certainly book a different hotel on our next visit to Vegas."
1688,The 'open account' process that automatically removed 150 dollars per day without approval or an explanation.
1689,The card to access the room was annoying as it would only work 50% of the time. One of the days I had to go back to check in and get the cards reactivated!!!!! Very annoying and a waste of my time ?
1690,"I did have a bad experience at the Venetian. I am extremely objective. The staff when doing the check out is not so friendly. If you've got questions about the final balance, you will be treated as a hostil guest, whom is trying to avoid payment (If you are in Las Vegas, you are there for betting and seeing amazing places not to avoid payments). I paid what I had been requested and left the hotel with bad humour because of their unnecessary roughness. I wasn't reciprocate with the staff so I was as polite as I always try to be."
1691,"The room was disappointing, not even close to as nice as advertised. Looked tired, even though it was clean it looked drab. Sad as we were very excited to stay in a highly starred hotel."
1692,"Had to check out a day early, but couldn't get a small credit back because I checked out at 1:45, but I guess it was my fault, but the stay was worth it"
1693,I do not like the smoking in the casino although I understand that a lot of people need it when they are playing but it just smells bad.
1694,"Our only criticism is the extremely cold temperature in the hallways, casino, restaurants, etc.  We were very uncomfortable with this."
1695,"Your rentals for the rooms are USDollar 300 which are quite expensive , you should include Breakfast in your room rate . This will give some frills to the guests ."
1696,"Well the  long walks to the rooms haha , seriously ladies walk with flats or comfy shoes and then change to your sexy heals   .. Because, the walk to the room are phew? , i lost 6 pounds hehe jk just from walking ☺️ other than that no complaints what so ever ."
1697,"Lack of a coffee maker, refrigerator and microwave! For a five star hotel, the basic items you would expect for the price were not there!"
1698,"We were locked  out of our room :( ... had to call security to get back in ... ""very inconvient"" ... key card & lock did't work ... an before we left we noticed another couple having same issue ..... :( :( :( ...."
1699,"The only clear sign about items being charged to my account was located inside the fridge. 
There was no other sign, for the penuts...water.
I think it's ridiculous, that we paid around five hundred dollars for a room and we could not even get a Botle of water or penuts as complimentary."
1700,"I wasn´t able to sleep good the first night, because the air conditioning wan´t working properly.
After I complain the following morning, they realize the filter was too dirty and clogging the air flow.
The TAO beach pool was very small."
1701,Getting charged for everything we touched in the minibar even if we hadn't used the items but was soon rectified at reception
1702,This is not limited to the Venetian but the smoke from the casino is terrible and made my head feel like a balloon with lots of post nasal drip.  Pretty stupid as well that they do not have some sort of free computer terminals for people wanting quick access to the net and not just use ones phone so that you can print your boarding pass. I did not use the resort portion of the facility (only the room) and was charged for a resort tax.  Would not stay here again if I had to just get a room.
1703,"Nowhere to place toiletries in the shower EG shelf. Water pressure in shower not great.
Conference on when we were there so very crowded and smoky in the casino. Bedside tables on each side of the 2 queen beds would be great too."
1704,"What a waste of money. Stay at a hotel off the strip, parking is free in all the parking lots. My room was dusty, the bathtub had hair in it. For $400 a night, I expect much better."
1705,The fact we couldn't stay longer!
1706,"I couldnt find my room, the floor plan is a mess. The cleaning lady can in at 1030 and we had a late check out. She asked if she couls start while we were still there. Daniel at check in asked for 20 cash for a better room? Cash?!"
1707,"Service is not a 5-star service.It took them 1h30 to bring the luggage into the room and the person who delivered the luggage spoke disrespectfully !
Cards of the room deactivated twice and we had to go back to the front desk.
At check-out, they forgot to redeem a discount we had.
The service is really poor"
1708,Can't believe smoking is allowed in the Casino - makes it a horrible experience if you hang around too long. Many of the activities in the hotel are far too expensive - felt I was being ripped off the whole time
1709,I was annoyed that for all that money there wasn't a refrigerator.  When I raised the shade there was a used bandaid on the ledge. The pillows were awful.
1710,The floors are arranged on a center elevator and the halls are very long so it's quite a hike up and down.  I thought the lobby and casino were kind of bland.
1711,The service on arrival was not at all good or efficient. Same can be said for the front desk help & the IT section. Wifi was a constant problem as was the plumbing in the sumptuous bathroom!
1712,"Reps at play tables are very rude, not helpful. Elevators were down not many walk way options made it difficult to transport without the functioning escalators/elevators"
1713,"The hotel is big and getting around is complex. Going to our room meant for us walking 10 minutes and waiting for two elevators all the time dragging our luggage though the carpets because no assistance was available. On entering the doorman is opening the doors for young ladies coming out but not assisting us or other guests packed with luggage entering the hotel. The waiting line for checking in was longer than expected. The quality of the guest is not five star at all, full of teenagers running around half naked everywhere (fresh from the pool) spending their parents money being drunk and loud. 
The rooms are spacious but lack basic amenities like a fridge, coffee maker or micro wave. The mini bar is so filled with drinks you cannot even put in your own small bottle of water and it is fully computerised so if you move something you pay. The prizes are ridiculous, even for Vegas. 
It has the look of a five star hotel but nothing else.
We will never book a room here again."
1714,Wrong bill including many consumption what we didn't have. FO didn't check with us and just printed the statement to us when we checked out.
1715,"Don't expect to be treated like a 5 star guest here, you're just another paying customer when you visit this hotel. Whilst the prices are high, the general feel of this hotel is nowhere near the Wynn, Bellagio or Caesars Palace. On Fridays and Saturdays the Venetian has a bit of an 'edge' to it which isn't pleasant when you're visiting as a couple, mid-week is nicer. We visited almost all of the hotels when we stayed and we preferred the atmosphere in NYNY, Mandalay Bay (and most surprisingly Luxor), although the rooms are probably not anywhere near the same standard as the suite rooms in the Venetian (if that's what's important to you) but for venetian money you can pay for a large suite in any of these other hotels which would probably be a decent standard (particularly with a good strip view). Whilst the Venetian is a great hotel, if we were visiting Las Vegas again we would spend a little more and go for Bellagio/Ceasars/Wynn or would save a little and go for NYNY/Luxor/Mandalay Bay."
1716,Little on the pricey side but was worth it.
1717,"The towels could do with replacing not fluffy as expected from this high end hotel, typical of American hotels no tea/coffee making in room. Reception is a long long way from the multi story,and the smell of smoke in the casino is awful."
1718,Drinks were ridiculously expensive. Only one bar on the casino floor- had to often wait a long time for service. Bar tenders in the casino bar were not very friendly. Food was over priced..
1719,You did had a good place to eat nothing was worth it
1720,to find the right way inside you feel like in a labyrinth and we lost much time to walk across all this corridors and floors
1721,My wife and I are not fans of Las Vegas so take comments with that in mind.  Two annoyances we had 1) no signs from the self-park garage to the registration desk.  The most obvious door to enter would take us through casino...with no signs again to registration.  2) One must walk down a long hall and through the casino from registration desk to the elevators to our room. The elevators are quite hidden.  Inconvenient but no doubt the intent of the casino to get people to stop along the way to gamble.  We don't gamble.
1722,i lost in the casino :( haha
1723,Our suite was way at the end of the aisle and it was quite a walk to get to the main lobby and back. No breakfast included for the price that we paid for ($280/ night x 3 nights). The shower took time to heat up. Had to wait for about 10 mins for the water to get a bit warm.
1724,"When checking in , they assigned us to a room that had already assigned to somebody else without saying sorry . I requested for a water heater , waited for 45 mins with extra payment . When checking out , some mini bar items were wrongly charged , till not , no progress update from hotel ."
1725,Don't open the fridge if you are not willing to use it (they take charge about 15$ just for the fact of opening).
1726,"As a so-called 5 star hotel, you couldn't book the tours or activities at the hotel Concierge. No custom service at all. No slippers or complimentary water in the Suite."
1727,"Food is too expensive, no complementary water in room. Don't take a taxi from the airport, $33 + airport fee + no working seat belts, and let me tell you, you want seat belts, cardboard lined trunk..."
1728,"For the price of standard suite, I think an upgrade might be something I would consider if I stay again. Standard suite is not what I had in mind for its price. Besides, what's a few $$ more to feel like a million bucks, right? Or perhaps, consider Palazzo. I believe it's newer room than Venetian."
1729,"I stayed at Venetian bella view suite. The room looked NOTHING like the photo.
I was very disappointed. And getting on 2 different elevator & too much walking from the lobby was not for me at all!"
1730,Our reservation was not in the Venetian system and that resulted in a small delay.  The agent was excellent and quickly figured it out.  I think her name was Rose.  She was super.
1731,"lo1.	Long check in line. 
2.	No bell boys to carry bags. I had two bags that I need to carry by myself. I think because of the huge number of guests they don’t offer this service.
3.	Guest services are very ordinary compared to other hotels with the same rank and I think this because of the same reason above.
ng check in line. I had two big bags that I have to carry by my self to my room"
1732,The price was a little high.
1733,"jet shower is very low... not practical to have a nice shower and wash your hair.
Not even a free bottle of water (you have to pay more than 5 dollars for the Venetian/palazzo bottle - which is the cheapest they have in room) included in the price of the room..."
1734,Being a non-smoker couple we always find smoking allowed facilities not to be clean - but this is a standard for all Las Vegas hotels.
1735,The little things - no tea making facility or ice tongs plus an electronic mini bar. Very expensive compared to nearby hotels.
1736,"My only thought is that the main pool area has to listen in to the music from the day club right next to it. Not that the day club should not be there or quiet, I just think they should also play a bit of music in the main pool area too so it has its own atmosphere and counteract the music from the pool next door."
1737,A little noisy from other room. Sometime you can hear other talk. Also you need to take care the mini bar food and drink because they are connected to the weigh sensitivity. Once you take them the hotel may be charge you
1738,the cue at checkin; wifi price 30 usd per day; rooms are located far from facilities; the request for late checkin as Genius booking guest was not responded
1739,"1) House keeping. 
2) Towels very old and worn out. 
3 room missing the some touches expected of a luxury hotel."
1740,"No kettle in rooms and paying 5 dollars to get one in spite of the bill of several Thousands! !
Emptying the mini bar by 50 dollars again in spite of the thousands of the bill"
1741,"Gaming floor not very big (compared to other Vegas hotels we have stayed at) but the hotel is joined to The Palazzo so just a short walk to bigger gaming floor.
Problem solved."
1742,The casino and surrounding restaurants were very smoky.. Compared to other casinos the air quality at the Venetian was poor.  Need a better filter system.
1743,Same as all casinos in Las Vegas. Smokers!!!!
1744,There was no place to store my insulin. So I had to keep refilling the ice bucket. Not a big deal.
1745,"Nothing, the hotel, staff, restaurants and facilities are excellent"
1746,Slow and intermittent wi fi. A coffee maker in the room is essential for morning coffee drinkers.
1747,Just the meals and drinks expensive..but that is everywhere in Vegas even in the cheap hotels
1748,"Enormous hotel, we asked for two connected rooms, they gave us separated. Disastrous check in, terribly slow. Very impersonal. Other hotels in the area seemed to be better"
1749,Too much smoking especially in the casino. Not enough areas to sit and queitly enoy the venue. Too many conferences and hens/bachelor parties. people smoke everywhere even where they shouldnt.
1750,"Well - 5 Stars, but no breakfast included. Wifi didnt work at all - but therefore we got a discount and had to pay 30 dollars less. the venetian is more a Shopping mall... if i could decide once again, i would pick other well known hotels at the strip."
1751,The tour traffic through the hotel was too much...could have been much nicer with out the constant crowds coming through
1752,"The check in process was not professional. Long line and the reception suggested upgrade with extra money to a better room with nice view, for which i agreed . I ended up in another far building that took long time to reach far from lobby with bad odour and the room was the same as the previous room and the view was not that great as he told me. I reurned back to reception and changed the room  I booked.  I did not find aconvencing answer to the game the receptionist played .  It took another extra time and delay in bringing the luggage."
1753,"The pools at the pool area were small, and everything was ridiculously priced. But that is Vegas these days. I would rate the value for everything but the room a sad face."
1754,Nothing to complain about. Not the cheapest option available.
1755,Can't complain about anything.
1756,"resort fee, transportation costs, second hand smoking in casino, bad view from room, gratuities, buffet prices the Barn Yard charges seventy dollars for little portions."
1757,We had to pay extra $45 per night to get a room with strip view which is something not normal looking at the standard of the hotel. There's no buffet breakfast option.
1758,We would agree with others we've read before going that the hotel badly needs to provide coffee making facilities which we would expect of hotels less than 5 star really. We'd moved here from a 4 star where we had a filter coffee machine.
1759,"The charge of $100 + to upgrade the room to view of the strip, the view was restricted to the north of the strip with not many sights to see, therefore do not take the upgrade if your room number is 200-260, it is not worth the additional cost."
1760,Lack of facilities once checked out and lack of bell boys
1761,"waiting too long for valet car parking 
20 min to bring my luggage to the room"
1762,"Hairs in bath tube, dirt splashes at the walls, damaged room equipment, staff not friendly...reduce two stars or adjust price!!!"
1763,"No breakfast included and cost of mini fridge items.
Surely if they made the costs of the contents the standard rates people would use them more. I don`t expect the costs to be cheap but not over expensive as they were."
1764,inspection the room before your guess check in...a lot of dusty on the bed.  Lock like there was no guess or no maintenance daily while it empty
1765,Found one of the little towels dirty with old eyeliner stain and the bed on the right side was sunken in.
1766,"casino staff is unfriendly, I mean really, really unfriendly (if you don't look like you're going to spend a fortune in the casino)
Booked in Venetian but got room in Palazzo withiut any apology! Annoying if you travel with friends since the Hotel is huge!"
1767,There is an issue in room hygiene. There was cockroaches everywhere in the room and the cleaning staff didn't even bother to remove them.
1768,"Pool closing time, $50 fee if you want to use the in room fridge for personal items, wifi was terrible in rooms."
1769,The free coffee was not honored.  The wifi did not work on my laptop.  I had to get an ethernet cord which worked fine.  A better map of the facilities with restaurant  and activities list would have been welcomed.
1770,Long ques for the valet parking
1771,A microwave in the suites will be great n also an empty fridge just in case guests wants to store food n drinks during their stay. And also my friend fell.
1772,Smoking everywhere. It's terrible. Not far they don't make parts of the casino non smoking.
1773,No refrigerator! Our room was very nice but because of its location we barely saw the light of day.. awful! Had to look to extreme left of Window to see the sun.Seriously would not know whether it was day or night.
1774,"had trouble with main desk clerks due to insufficient funds on my bank card had to pay balance in cash first one told me a figure saw another and was told i had been charged too much had to go back later and was told they had undercharged by the same amount as before , this took about 9 days to come to light    still not sure if ive been done or not"
1775,"everything food wise, closed too early
replenishment of the shampoos and moisturiser didnt happen on one of the cleaning days."
1776,"Staff were not nice both front desk and phone call. I was very disappointed. before arriving I talking to managers in email for reservation b/c they are my friend' acquaintances and they kindly took care of me, however after my stay even though I emailed them again to request something about my stay, for a few times, they never reply me, still..."
1777,They don't serve breakfast by the pool. (pool opens at 8am).
1778,"Wifi was pretty spotty in the hotel room.
Booked a reservation for dinner at an Italian restaurant to celebrate a birthday and the Concierge service asked if it was for an occasion but the restaurant staff wasn't great and didn't seem to know that it was a special occasion. It was disappointing to have the occasion not recognized, especially since the Concierge staff seemed to intent on getting these details. Had better, more attentive experiences at other restaurants elsewhere on the Strip during my stay."
1779,"Everything in the Hotel much more expensive than outside, my crédit card was charged for more than what was on the bill"
1780,This hotel is massive and arguably too big to appreciate even over 3 days!
1781,Huge facility therefore check in is loud and overwhelming. Maps essential just to find your way around the complex.
1782,No free wifi...that's all I got.
1783,"we had to Pay 100$ more for the early Check Out..
Hôtel top big and we were far from  the central place and so easy to get lost"
1784,"The distance from the car park to the reception back to the elevators to
room was huge. The fuse blew when we were using the hair dryer, tripped
the light so engineer had to come. The view was ok, but we could barely
see the strip and there was a building site opposite. Paid the same as
the Bellagio and would rather stay there."
1785,"It can be a little creepy, it is a giant hotel. It took me 30 minutes to get out of the hotel. I also did not like the connectiong door to the other room from my suite, i can hear all the noises. It also has a fake feeling."
1786,Resort fee mandatory:32$/room. We weren't aware.
1787,Attitude to customers.  Transitory business attitude. Breakfast is only to be taken in the room vs in the 7 restaurants onsite.  Hotel staff apparently think they can't influence customer perception and hence do not try.
1788,Decor is a little dated compared to newer casinos. No drinking fountains on floors or drinking water in room that wasn't in mini bar.
1789,Nada.
1790,Pools were not as cool as some of the others in Vegas which have fountains and rapids etc.
1791,"Shower pressure really hard it hurt, missing items in room such as: robe, pillows, ice tongs.  Room service forgot several things on our order.  Pools were over crowded."
1792,"Too much to walk from valet parking to reception and from there to the room elevators. It'a big maze and very bay signed!
Big disappointment! Price way to high for the lousy service and hotel facility. I don't car about the casino facilities. The hotel is not worth 5 stars - especially considering the very high room prices."
1793,Didn't get the room I booked. Everything massively overpriced. Snacks in the room over a year out of date.
1794,"Such a busy and huge hotel despite this being our final stop on our honeymoon, there was no special treatment or acknowledgement even though we had mentioned this on booking so that was a little disappointing"
1795,Access to the guest elevators was reasonably away from the hotel entrance. It was bit of an inconvenience for me to carry all my luggage from the valet drop-off (in the parking building) to the check-in desks.
1796,There are no coffeemaker in the room. You can either pay 5 dollars to rent one or 2 dollars to have one pot of hot water. The first hotel in the States that I stayed with no coffeemaker. Just the A/C is way too strong on the lower floor than the higher.
1797,"They allow smoking on the casino floor, as a non smoker this was awful and as we not use to it it came as a shock"
1798,"The toilet didn't work, nor the shower (water couldn't flush in both cases). Toilet got fixed but we didn't have time to wait for someone to fix the shower too so we used the bathtub instead. In such a hotel you can't just accept it! There wasn't any coffee nor tea machine in the suite. Very unkind staff at one of the private swimming pools."
1799,Price does not include breakfast
1800,The pool area was very crowded and the pool itself was warm and a bit grubby. Wouldn't stop me from staying here again though!
1801,The grout in our shower showed quite a bit of mold.... surprising since the rest of the suite was in very good condition....
1802,"We had problems with clogged toilet which eventually flooded the shower stall and the tub with smelly water. The maintenance guys could not fix the problem and had a hard time convincing the front desk to change our room. Eventually, they agree to change our room and we had to make a move at 3:00am."
1803,"no coffee pot in the room and no hair dryer our guests lifted out tiny bottles from fridge but replaced ,,,just looking we were charged and did not even use the drinks"
1804,"We have stayed at Venetian/palazzo  7 time prior to this visit.  From checkin onwards this was our worst trip was tried to take an upgraded room to which we had booked and made to feel cheap when we declined.  There do not seem to be as much bar staff as previous visits, pool areas were closed just not as good as it was."
1805,"because it is one of the famous in Las Vegas strip, it is too crowded. the room is stylish, but a little bit old.. too cold in the bathroom. too much people and space, easy to get lost. the staff is well trained."
1806,"Horrible in cleaniness, we find ball of hair, dust everywhere in room, food crumbs all over floor.refrigater is not usable, very greedy plans, objective is profit centered not client focus. Will never rommend, we have to stay one more day as we can not book anywhere now."
1807,Nothing bad! Just be prepared for long walks to your room from reception but I don't count this as a negative.
1808,we left our luggages but it took more than 1 hour for us to get them to my room
1809,"1. Not being aware of additional costs associated with site facilities such as access to the pool and gym; approx $32 per day which can add up if staying for any length of time.  
Not a biggie, but this added a reasonable overall cost to the trip which I would like to have been made aware of before choosing this or any other location."
1810,"There are several pools outside however if you do not book a cabana, there is no way that you can get a bit of shadow after 12pm."
1811,Breakfast did not turn up when we ordered it and then turned up when we did not order any this needs to be looked at
1812,"the floor is wet and the stuff service is normal. 
部屋は広くてキレイめだが、床は濡れているし、お風呂場もにおいがするしでスイートというほどではなかった。コーヒーだけ無料だがほかはすべて料金が取られるので、正直モーテルなどのほうがくつろげる場がたくさんあった。"
1813,"The time and distance taken to reach rooms its take more than ten minuts just to get to room from thr reciption
Breakfast menu is very poor"
1814,Part of a residential complex in the heart of Hollywood Boulevard that could be quite intimidating due to homeless and begging
1815,Very busy in the weekend. In itself not a problem -Vegas is a party city- but you would expect doors which are somewhat soundproof. It was as if the screeming people who were passing by in the hallway all night were sitting on my bed.
1816,Nothing.
1817,"Very busy , a lot of public using venetian as shopping centre and walk thru. Venetian staff and shopping staff very pushy to sell you things and get you into there store , to the point of not wanting to walk the canal shops because of this. saturday at the pool had a real ""spring break"" feel about it , no place for children but awesome time if your into a party"
1818,Long time to wait our car in the valley. elevator outside the hotel not working. They give us the wrong room with no view and derty.  the location far.
1819,I had hoped for a room with a better view when I told them it was our anniversary. Our room had a view of the HVAC systems on the roof. As an IHG member I had hoped for more but the reality is you aren't in your room that much
1820,"No negative experience with Venetian, albeit we stayed in more famed hotels in Vegas, and the Venetian was the best deal in price / comfort ratio."
1821,"The bathroom was a little 'rush cleaned' the first day- the toilet wasn't overly clean on the seat, and the sink had a hair in it, but I must say that after this the room always appeared very clean and tidy. Expensive mini bar- in a room like this, to be expected."
1822,Little pricey. But you get what you pay for. Beautiful hotel. And great staff.
1823,"Ordered fridge before we arrived and upon arrival the original request qasnt recorded).  They said it would be up about 15 mins,  after about an hour we called and they said there was no record of it.  After that call we received on about 15-20.
Problems with keys deactivating several times."
1824,No buffet!
1825,Only downside was the lack of chairs by the pool and that smoking was allowed by the pool. Not relaxing at all. I went out at 7:30am to sit by the pool and all the lounge chairs were taken (towels placed on chairs)
1826,Very very busy. Pool areas crowded and nowhere you can really swim - all shallow and full of people
1827,The parking was so so.
1828,Too many times we had to walk through a smoke filled casino to get to our room. Not everyone comes to Las Vegas for the gambling. Please consider families who to not want to smoke or gamble.
1829,"2 little uninvited ""guests"" in the bathroom (cockroach)."
1830,"My wife didn't like the 'smell' and on leaving I saw that the bathroom vent hadn't been cleaned in a long time.  Cost was high.  King bead wasn't a king sized bed.  No DVD player ""rooms are being renovated"" - no coffee maker... Map, etc is confusing to say the least."
1831,"There were no negative experiences for my wife or I. However, I would express my concern about the lack of a grab bar in the glass shower. I am 6'1"" and did feel a bit insecure about the possibility of losing my footing in a glass enclosure with only a tiny brass entry know to hold on to. In fairness I should say that my wife at just 5'2"" did not express the same concern."
1832,"The most greedy staff and hotel I have ever visited. Absolutely poor
hospitality. Facilites are there but you have to pay a lot. Paid for
breakfast but no buffet - just order eggs in room. Fridge is there but
if you even touch anything sensors detect and charge you. Staff wants
15% gratuity for everything. No tea or coffee maker in room. Waited 25
mins in line to check-in. Waited 1 hour for my luggage to be delivered
or to be picked and hotel refused to extend check-out time by even half
an hour. Pool closes at 7 pm. They charge you a resort fee of 33$ but
even the internal gondola ride in the hotel is not free which is again
useless, short and the photo taken is more expensive than the ride
itself. Disappointing."
1833,"Feels impersonal and a little like a cattle market, however I guess that is Vegas.
Variety of eateries for teenage children was not great. Both our children (17 & 14) said they wish we had chosen other hotels that we visited."
1834,Treat kids like 2nd class citizens. Pretty sad. Casino folks were like robots. A little personality wouldn't hurt. Even an occasional smile helpful.
1835,"Very bad in-suite dining service with poor management. No one cares whether you are satified or not. With such staff behaviour, they will lose more customers every day. I do not recommend this hotel"
1836,"The add on resort fees at the end of the Bill not included in the reservation fee Why!!!. 
No sun lounge canopys around the pool. It was 44 degrees and no shade. If you wanted shade $500 really!!!"
1837,"the bed was as soft as a waterbed, which was so uncomfortable to all my family members.  
quite surprising that the there were no complimentary water, toothbrush and slippers, which might be the standard in the US."
1838,"Sometimes the crowd in the casino part of the hotel is huge, and you need to pass this area on your way to the hotel room. Can be a bit daunting at first. Also, be prepared to walk quite a bit to and from your room."
1839,It's extremely big! But that it's a personal matter.
1840,You have to book the gonadal ride early in the day if you want to ride that evening.
1841,"I did not like that the room did not have a DVD player to play movies. I had brought the DVD from my wedding for my husband and I to watch, but no DVD player.  For that amount of money to rent a room there should be a DVD player."
1842,"If you self park, it's at least a 10 minute hike from parking garage to the registration desk. Used room service plates and glasses were left sitting outside rooms in our hallway for over 6 hours before they were picked up."
1843,"Not the service you would expect from the Venetian. The room was dirty when we arrived and there was someones hair in the shower. When I called the front desk they did nothing to rectify the situation which tells me they don't care about their customer service. Will never stay here again, with so many better choices in Vegas."
1844,I did'nt win more money at the casino!!!
1845,The shower clogged. I guess it didn't bother since it was our last day for the stay.
1846,"Breakfast was very poor, served cold and when returned staff forgot about the replacement meal. Really soured the experience from an otherwise wonderful stay."
1847,"Rather impersonal, valet parking collection takes time, pool was dirty and very crowded."
1848,"The only thing that bothered me a little was the aggressiveness of the sales people throughout the shop areas.  We were constantly stopped by someone offering us tickets, samples, coupons, etc.  I finally figured out we just need to say no thank you and keep walking, but it was still kind of annoying.  I did not take that as a reflection on the Venetian however."
1849,What a fantastic hotel in the heart of the strip.  What we liked was that although there were a lot of people there it never felt crowded like some of the other hotels we visited.
1850,Pressured selling at check-in to upgrade our pre-booked and confirmed room.  Room was dirty not dusted or vacuumed. Previous owners underwear in drawer. Wi-Fi did not work at all. Toilet blocked. Not enough towels. Huge hotel = Indifferent staff.
1851,"It took more than an hour to have our bags brought down from our room to our car. All the time we waited next to our car in the driveway. We made several reminder requests and pleas but still it took over an hour. Not acceptable for a 5 star hotel. 
Breakfast was not included and there was no shuttle to take guests up or down the strip. 
Next time I would probably stay at a hotel a bit further down the strip or at a hotel which offers a shuttle."
1852,I had to pay a fee to get hot water in a cup which I feel is ridiculous as long as I'm paying over 400 for a room
1853,A lot of the people that worked at the resort didn't give good directions on how to get different. They sent us on a wild goose chase. They didn't where Prime Burger was. After walking over an hour we found it in the food court.
1854,The amount of the deposit held on my credit card $150 per day but it worked out since we won money gambling.
1855,I reserved a not smoking room and for the amount spent they had none available. We had to run an air humidifier the whole weekend. That really upset me and we've already planned a return trip but not to your hotel as s result.
1856,"Valet was very poor.  ""Valet"" to them means you drive into the parking garage up a level or two, at which point the ""valet"" takes your car.  Shame on you Venetian."
1857,"Everything was too expensive: room $200 per night, restaurants meals overvalued, water $3 or more per bottle."
1858,In room breakfast was limited in choice of food
1859,"Too many supplementary charges for using pools, steam sauna which was not available due to out of order and 
No buffet restaurant 
Staff training is required to show hospitality to hotel guests,i.e. Fast and business mind Customer respond"
1860,"This resort si forse a mass production no attention to the guest can be given due to the massive number of guest and during the pick time it is a mess supercroweded . Justification given was "" we are so busy"" well I do not pay for this answer"
1861,"Hair in the bathroom, disgusting
Main window had a lot of cloth which we could see at daylight"
1862,Weight sensing minibar didn't allow use as a fridge.  The resort fee that gets added per day should be disclosed as part of the price.
1863,"- the breakfast in the room was ok but not the way we ordered it. 
- We had a really bad smell in our bathroom. They were very quick to come and take a look at it though."
1864,"Didn't like the restaurant pick by concierge, so we picked ourselves from then on."
1865,"Smell of smoking spreads out beyond casino, but I guess it's the same situation everywhere else you stay in LV"
1866,"Wifi was very slow
The hotel had lack of ambience as was way too big,the service was very average
Lining up even to check in and out was interesting"
1867,"The only thing I didn't like was the actual bed in our luxury suite.
The bed was hard and a bit uncomfortable on my back."
1868,The people trying to sell tickets to shows were annoying. If I wanted tickets to a show I would ask for them!
1869,The breakfast (served in-room) was below par and disappointing.
1870,The Bill :)
1871,"i didn't like the fact that the casino section is authorising smoking.
But this is the case for all Vegas' hotel/casino."
1872,"My wife and young daugther came a couple of hours before me in the hotel . They could not get in as the reservation through Booking was under my name . I called them , told them that the 1st night was already paid . My wife and daughter had to wait 3 hours with 110F . Unacceptable ."
1873,"Breakfast option we got was only in-room dining and very limited vegetarian choices
Beware the minibar - it will charge for anything you remove, even if you put it back!"
1874,"While gambling the cocktail waitresses could take quite a while.   I waited, on several occasions  up to 45 minutes.  If I went to the bar they wanted me to pay."
1875,"On our first day, we entered the bathroom to find a used, fake eyelash
on the floor. Eww. While my son was making a fort in the living area, we
found a month old receipt and other trash items. On the third day,
housekeeping did not leave any bath towels or hand towels. Cleanliness
was an issue. If I am going to pay the price, the least I should receive
is a clean room."
1876,"The room upgrade to view of the strip was not worth it. Could only see a tiny bit of the strip. Also the wifi in the room didn't work, but they did refund us the resort fee so I can't complain."
1877,"Resort was so big you can often get lost!
Swimming pool decks were too small for size of resort and amount of people which was over 7,000 rooms :-(
We didnt realise coffee was included in resort fee of 29 USD per day and were not advised of this at check in so read small print!!"
1878,"The room was dirty, especially the bathroom. Bath hadn't been cleaned for a very long time. And the toilet wall was horrible.  We left a glass on the coffee table (empty) which was never washed.  The pool area had no umbrellas and there was no shade. Always having to wait for pool towels to be delivered even first thing in the morning (9 o'clock)"
1879,"The only thing I can say is that the hotel was so big, we couldn't always find our way back to the room, but there were guards everywhere and they were really helpful. And also, everything is off course very expensive. A bottle of water 7 dollars. But we knew this before we got here and were prepared."
1880,"Passage ways on ground floor through the casino are too narrow to cater for large volume of people, including tourist groups coming to look at the hotel. Walking through here ( which was unavoidable ) was an uncomfortable experience."
1881,At check-in given a room in Palazzo even though booked Venetian. Extremely disappointed. It was eventually sorted but at great inconvenience.
1882,"We were set up in Pallazzo. Most of the time the wifi doesn't work. And the bath has a water leaking problem. Also, we are informed not to touch the fridge cos we would be changed if putting stuff into it. It's on the other end of the Blv so it's a long walk to anywhere else in a 45degree hot city."
1883,"We would have liked a later checkout, but thats just how it goes!"
1884,"The only reason I would not stay at the Venetian again is the enormous size of the property.  I felt the property was too spread out and hard to navigate.  The 3 days I was there, I had to ask for directions back to my room several times.  That's never happened to me at the Bellagio or Paris hotels.  Once in the canal shoppes I also had a hard time finding stores I was looking for.  The walkway meanders and at some points if you don't make a sharp turn, you can miss a critical walkway.  The hotel was very noisy because there is a lot of beautiful marble which does not absorb sound.  I think efforts should be made to introduce more wall tapestries to muffle the sound.  I also think the security is too lax about letting people enter the elevators to the rooms."
1885,"The layout is horrible.  It was literally ten minutes of walking to get to the room from the lobby.  Up two elevators, multiple hallways.  Horribly inconvenient."
1886,"Lack of amenities for being a resort. Although the room price was very reasonable, everything else is very expensive!"
1887,"This Hotel is NOT what you expect to be!
I've booked our room into the Venetian for 8nights.
Our plane arrived to Las Vegas at night, we came to the hotel around midnight.
There was a 30MINUTE line for checking in.
After 14hours of flying with my pregnant wife,didn't really felt good.
They told us that they place us into the palazzo because they are full.
I left a comment when I booked the room,that we need a room somewhere high.
They gave a room on the 5th floor out of 50!!!
We had to find our room by ourselves,and it took like 20-30 minutes (at midnight,after 14hours of flying, with a pregnant women).
Great! So the room is spacious,but nothing special,especially for such a price.
Our booking included breakfast. What Breakfast means here; Hanging on the phone (not kidding) for like 40 minutes,to be connected to the In suit dining phone!!!
We ordered some scrambled eggs,it took more than one and a half ours.
There is no place for people to sit down when you check in, you can just stand there in the line,not even a chair to sit!
We went to the pool, and I have to say, this hotel was not build for so many people!
You can't find a place near the swimming pools.
We left our room in the morning with a cleaning request and when we came back In the afternoon, the room was still the same. They had 5hours to clean it.
So if you consider to come to Las Vegas,do not choose this hotel.. There are much better hotels in Vegas.
 Looks old and there are LOT OF DISAPPOINTMENTS!:(("
1888,"The music on the main pool was too loud and totally not my stile
It is expensive...but totally worth it"
1889,It's such a hot place ... Ice cubes are also charged if it's ordered in room ..
1890,None at all
1891,"Because of airline mechanical problems my take-off was delayed by 3 hours. My initial accommodation was not available when I arrived,even though I called the hotel to advise I would be late. I got shifted to another room. Don't know what I missed..."
1892,"Never seen such arrogant and indifferent attitude of staff all across, in my life time in a hotel."
1893,This is a very popular hotel so there will be waiting lines to check in / out
1894,"No tea or coffee facilities in our suite would be my only complaint but the coffee shop made up for that, just a shame it was not closer"
1895,"I didn't know that there were two towers, the Venetian and the Palazzo, and they are pretty far away from each other. I had booked into the one and checked in to the other. Not a big deal, but good to know."
1896,"Not having tea& coffee facilities in our room. This trip we have stayed in 3 other hotels in Canada  & USA & the Venetian was the only one not offering this facility.
Not having any umbrellas for shade around the pool areas - very unlike the Bellagio !
Few quiet areas for older guests - loud music everywhere"
1897,View from room but we were told on check in did we want to upgrade for extra to a room with a good view.
1898,"Sometimes some of the staff seemed slightly ignorant to the idea of ""hospitality"""
1899,High resort fee and was not able to connect to Internet. Very difficult to reach the front desk. Very few video poker machines. Lots of noise in the hall at wee hours
1900,Breakfast was included and served in room but impossible to connect to in suite dining phone number to order it on both days. Had to go to reception to order and then took another 45mins to arrive!
1901,Nothing!
1902,"This place is so huge that it is a very long, winding way from the self-parking to the check-in area."
1903,"One of the three TVs could have been in the sitting room with the comfy couch.  The existence of a pressurized snack bar was not explained properly and caused a lot of stress worrying about charges. Expensive dining in hotel left us to leave Palazzo/Venician to find more reasonably priced dining.  Our pool experience was poor because we had to compete for space or pay for the ""exclusive"" pool."
1904,"Would prefer more shade around the pool areas.  Especially during the summer months, as the sun is incredibly strong."
1905,however the mini bar is the most aggressive I have ever seen and a real shame.   The is not a place to keep your leftovers since the fridge is designed to get you to spend more money and not provide a service.
1906,Nothing
1907,"I requested through Booking.com that our checkin time be earlier. When we got to the resort, they said we could wait 3hrs to checkin, or checkin now, but have to pay $40 extra $$ per night! We couldn't wait, so we ended up paying. Our choice, but still sucked."
1908,"I forget to call housekeeping the first two nights and ask for turn down service.  The night I did call, there was a delicious chocolate awaiting us."
1909,Slow response by staff to finally resolve issues w/two rooms.  They finally made it right after we waited over an hour for keys to a new room & for them to repair lock on other room.
1910,I wish the pool would open earlier then 8am.
1911,"Staff-maids knocking at our door twice in early morning (8am and 8:30am) they said they has been scheduled to do the housekeeping!! check out time is 11am!! on the first day, maid left some linen in our room!
Room-we have to walk around the room to turn the light on and off.
Breakfast-We booked 2 nights but breakfast is for one day only!! why???"
1912,"It can take a while to get anywhere because it is so large, but I guess that comes with the fact that this hotel has everything."
1913,"dining n breakfast is very poor also the dining area staff is arogent . The room service is too late , no cleaning in swimming area n no rules in swimming pool , there we found towels inside , more snacks particles , some are with wine n bear bottles inside it , this is the worst pool I ever seen . Also there is no playing area or any kids zone in the hotel even though it is 5 star hotel . This is what I say is 3 star hotel."
1914,Slightly confusing to find your way around the hotel due to its size and odd layout
1915,I was taking a nap and the cleaning staff decided to come into the room for a check up.  They woke me up and i could not fall asleep again.  It was so rude.
1916,"A bottle of Sam's Club water would've been nice. Had to drink
out of the tap. I will not pay $5.50 for a bottle of anybody's
water. The Internet service needs work."
1917,"My daughter's room had hair balls in the showeR when we arrived. The
used glasses were not replaced when housekeeping did our room. It took
more than 10 minutes to call front desk at 6 pm to get the glasses
replaced so I hung up. Made the call from the house phone outside the
guest elevators, operator picked up inmediately."
1918,"The not included tax and cost when u book the hotel,my room it cost 200$
more once I checked out !"
1919,The only negative I can think of is the cost of the in-room items. We didn't use anything as it was too pricey.
1920,Ordered coffee and it took 75 minutes to arrive.
1921,Watch out for the hidden charges at check out. Understand that these have to be paid but would have rather these be included in the total price when booking
1922,"We did not receive our luggage for over 2 hours with 5 phone calls, frustration and total lack of follow up
I had to ask for management in order to make it happen
I will not stay with you again!!!!"
1923,"on our last full day we left the room at 1:pm upon return at 7:30 pm our room had not been cleaned, housekeeping was my only disappointment very rude phone operator saying I should have called to ask for the service you charged extra 70.00 for the final night and no Bed made up or clean towels, you should refund the extra charge !"
1924,"Checkin was supposed to be at 3:00 PM, we finally got our room at 4:15 PM.  Housekeeping only cleaned the room one day so we had to stay in a dirty room with no soap or fresh towels.  We also didn't have power in our bathroom for 2 days."
1925,Hotel said they don't have my booking. Had to wait for hours at check in to resolve it. They told me either tell booking to send us a fax (it's 2015) or you can find somewhere else to stay (it was past midnight)! awful overall experience.
1926,"For a hotel that claims to be luxury high end, they provide cheap toiletries. Luxury hotels typically provide quality (at least B+) brand toiletries. The Venetian provides Paiza a no name brand owned by Las Vegas Sands Corp.
Also, they charge a facility fee of $29 per day."
1927,"No space inside the small fridge to put my baby's food and milk, very expensive room, it doesn't look like a suite"
1928,Everything eas good no complaints at all
1929,Access in the hotel was a bit under expectations as the Moving Walkway was stopped from one side while the other walking entrance was going a large rounding. But wasn't that bad at the end even for some Lazy a***s like us.
1930,Bathroom had plumbing issues and room reeled of cigars.
1931,"1. Tao Beach club 2% of Pool area and ruins the other 98% with loud music echoing off huge hotel building and back across sunbathers at the various pools.
2. Housekeeping  skipped us.
3. In room breakfast was hot one day and cold the next."
1932,Noise level in room overlooking pool was excessive due to air conditioning plants situated below.
1933,"There's really nothing I didn't like about my whole experience
with The Venetian."
1934,"We would love to bring our children back, just wondering how we would afford two rooms since we have three boys."
1935,"Loudy people arround my Suit>
Suite massage too expansive for the service"
1936,"For a rate of 285 per night (before taxes and resort fees) we would expect also a breakfast (or at least coffee/tea maker in the room). 
Mini bar extremely overpriced (didn't touch it). The walking distances within the hotel are huge. 
The beds are overly smooth (you find yourself sunk in there). 
The pool is very shallow and small (compared to other Vegas hotels). 
 Unfortunately our room was on the back of the hotel and had no view of the pool/strip (just distant mountains and the air-conditioning facilities)"
1937,Make sure you put all names on your room booking staff did not inform us but you can't get in due security without a room key and if you are not the lead Booker they will not give you one! And it's a BIG hotel to be walking around!!
1938,"Room service takes quite long, in-room service personell could be more friendly"
1939,"Hi There,
I was not allowed to check using IHG counter in although I have IHG reward miles !! 
I asked during check out to show the nights evenly as when I book it shows total price without breakdown. when the final bill was printed the price per night is different this is not acceptable at all !!"
1940,"* Had to ask for new key cards because the first pair didn't work
* Included breakfast is a joke -  we didn't bother to call for an egg (we are used to complimentary continental breakfast)
* No complimentary water in suite. Yes, it's a desert but we are staying in 5* hotel, a bottle of water would not cripple the place!
* Printer in the suite but no coffee"
1941,Very poor signage to find your way around the hotel. Pools are too small for the occupancy size of the hotel. The pool areas do not get enough sun light.
1942,"I've booked through Booking, immediately money was taken as hold. I came to hotel, seems booking.com and hotel aren't aligned and hotel wanted to charge me higher price. Hotel desk manager argued with me and at the beginning stated we can't do much!!!! After arguing for 25 minutes - she agreed to go with price I got in booking.com. Not pleasant timing.
Spa isn't free for guests ($ 30) - imagine I've paid over $ 400 per night and spa entrance isn't included."
1943,It was very crowded due to the fight.
1944,"Room service incredibly slow.  Staff were great except for a really rude , incompetent lady at in-dining called Claudine."
1945,"The noise from the neighboring rooms, especially at night, it woke us up almost every night. Also, the resort facilities fee amounting of 25 USD for every day has been taken although we didn't use any of the existing facilities (gym, spa.. Etc), I believe it should be optional."
1946,"Resort fees added on after (bare this in mind when booking prices), potentially 'too big' for some peoples tastes"
1947,"The way the hotel is organized (like many Vegas hotels) it is designed to confuse you and keep you in the casino. While I understand that tactic, I'm not a gambler and I hated that it took 30 mins to find my room again. The signs are unclear and the numbering sequences are terrible."
1948,"We were not satisfied with the comfort of bed, the mattress was very soft. Also, the water pressure in the shower was very poor. Btw we stayed in the Venetian luxury suite."
1949,Booking through booking.com was with B'fast & upon check in the receptions clearly mentioned that B'fast is in-room dining only. Upon ordering it would take 2-3 hrs to receive your B'fast which was not worth eating...........Absolutely ridiculous
1950,I made two call prior to coming. I was told twice I would get a complimentary breakfast  in my room. I paid 76.00 for 1 breakfast. That was shock to me.
1951,breakfast could have been better
1952,"Bed tilted toward the middle. The included breakfast was (3) 1 by 2 inch pastries,a fruit cup and coffee.We had to buy a real breakfast. Your add shows a real breakfast not a Continental breakfast. Chairs in sitting area are not very comfortable, should have an ottoman or recliner in sitting area."
1953,"No privacy: they are different than other hotels, as long as there is no ""don't disturb"" sign, the staff will knock once then open the door from outside."
1954,"No one didn't escort us to find our room. This hotel is a huge 5-Star complex so someone should escort guests like all other 5-Star hotels. You have to wait in long lines for reception, concierge desk etc."
1955,When we got our keys we went up to our room and there were people already booked in it. It was so embarassing then we went back downstairs and they said they would comp one night but then when we checked out they only gave us 1/2 off on one night. For a huge hotel like this you would think they would take better care of their guests.
1956,I would have liked a coffee machine in the room
1957,"The room I was checked in was dark. The scanner/ printer was out of ink and no cords to connect for printing. I requested from the front desk and was told it would be fixed when I return but that was not the case. I work in Las Vegas every month and the reason why I liked staying at the Venetian was due to this office set up.  In the casino area, I played slot machine for a few hours and not once did I get approached by a waitress for drinks. Rather disappointing."
1958,Room for not taking interest in placing coffee maker. No slippers and noise from other room heard inside our room.
1959,Unfortunately the WiFi was virtually useless. It was necessary to move out of the bedroom to get a decent reception. Although we bought our food at the hotel the mini bar was so crowded-impossible to fit our food in.
1960,"Paying for water, which is pretty standard in most hotels these days, especially 4-5 star hotels. We even had to pay for the delivery of a kettle.
Breakfast in-suite deal was same daily. 
Eggs does not mean omelette, and wasn't vegetarian friendly."
1961,"No hot water dispenser for hot tea, etc.  I like to have a hot beverage upon awakening.  Having to get dressed and go 30+ floors before coffee is challenging."
1962,"The money was not worthy for what you get , and it coast alot. Everything you do they charge you money. We went for our honeymoon and the hotel didnt gave us nothing on the house. 
We were very disappointed!!"
1963,"The breakfast wasn't great.  They offered eggs, but if you wanted an omelet, they would only do eggs.  Even to put cheese on it would have been extra"
1964,"The breakfast was one choice and u will get bord of it, daily egg, no other choices like cereals ...etc. probably it is a way to stop ordering it looool."
1965,we got voucher for breakfast in room but we couldnt use it because their kitchen is too busy when request breakfast and we didnt get it
1966,Nothing to be honest.
1967,"2-3 hours waitting for the in-door breakfast and whole day waitting fir picking it up.
No body came to assist us toward our room and no carry our laggage.
No Buffet for meals.
Poor policy for the mini-bar."
1968,The service wasn't good. The room we booked online wasn't available and we had to make several complaints. To be fair they were dealt with very well but ideally they shouldn't have happened in the first place!
1969,Included breakfast has to be to your room although the breakfast was good you do need to order the night before to get on time
1970,"The bad experience was at arrival, we have booked a Bed & Breakfast included for 2 nights.
the staff at reception said that we could have breakfast at any facility and charge it to the room and that they had a limited amount included , if we spend more they will charge it to our credit card at check out.
On checking out the Clerck at reception informed  me that the breakfast is included if it is delivered to the room. This was totaly false because his colleague did not say the same thing. 
i ended up paying 4 breakfast and charged in full to my credit card. 
Booking.com should specify exactly what is included and what is not and i suggest that you never include breakfast with such hôtels as in Vegas because they do not have a service restaurant that provides such amnety."
1971,"Too large, too difficult to get to the hundreds of shops, restaurants and attractions it offers.  To get to anything, including pools, restaurants, shops and main lobby you are required to take two banks of elevators none of which are even remotely connected to one another. If you like walking as an exercise, you're gonna love the Venetian. Here's an odd ball dislike, we stayed in the Venetzia Tower, which is apart from the Venetian Tower. Doesn't sound confusing until you enter an elevator and have to remember which of those two buttons you should press to get where you'd like to go."
1972,"Called the night before leaving to extend out stay 3 more nights. Lady confirmed this was fine but check in the morning for new night rates. Hotel had then been sold out. not sure why she didn't reserve the room when I was happy with the rate offered the night before.
All feed back on reviews are 100% correct expect the $50 a night upgrade to a room with a view."
1973,"Slightly expensive, limited wifi coverage, didn't use any resort facilities even though paid the fee as didn't know where the gym was or the timing of operation."
1974,"The fourth floor was under construction so it made it a bit of a hassle to get to the pool, but no a deal breaker."
1975,"Based on the price I paid to stay a few nights, it gives the impression
of a 5 star hotel and I'm sure it is. But the problem is not in the
building or the quality of the furnishing etc, its in the service you
get. I truly felt better treated in 3 star hotels than I felt here. In
this hotel you pay for absolutely everything - you will feel as indeed
it is a hotel made for the lucky few who's money grows on trees.
Complimentary breakfast is of decent quality, but you will find out that
it is a specific set of ingredients that unless you like
""salty"" things in the morning, there's nothing for you.
The option is ""eggs, sausage, ham, bacon, bread, juice, coffee, hot
chocolate and tea"" - that's it. If that's not your taste,
everything else is $$$'S. oh and expect a wait time of about 60 to
90mins to get your breakfast - no exceptions, unless you order the night
before for a specific hour. I would never go here again unless its a
massively reduced special price. But if service is not an issue, you
will be blown away by the building you're staying in - that's
without a doubt."
1976,"Upon arriving at The Venetian, our bell hop was extremely rude, didn't great us or even smile. After checking in I was so excited to see our room which happened to smell like barf. . Our restroom to be exact. Our luggage was lost and  our room phone was not functioning properly. Front desk promised a manager but I never spoke to anyone. Horrible experience, and my card on file was charged two times."
1977,the majority of the restaurants are too expensive and definitely not worth it.
1978,The mandatory resort fee as with most of the strip hotels is just an added extra that you don't really get any benefit of.
1979,"Caution...we were charged for in suite refreshments, when in fact, we did not touch any of the ""treats"".  One phone call and we were immediately issued a credit against the total bill without any harassment.  Needless to say, we plan on coming back."
1980,The Venetian along with most other mega casinos on the Strip have increased their advantage by paying blackjack 6:5 instead of the traditional 3:2. gamble off the Strip for better odds.
1981,That we didn't have a view of the strip and not enough time to enjoy more of the hotel amenities
1982,The room is not as big as It seems in the picture! They just use the reflection of the window to make a illusion. And it's not as good looking as it seems to be. We have four people in the suite. But the beds are really small. Four people living in the same room is too crowded.
1983,"Takes 30 minutes to get from place to place within the hotel - very confusing to get around. When I asked if I could get mail delivered to the hotel, I was not told there would be a $7 handling fee, so that was an unpleasant surprise."
1984,No adaptor for overseas travellers to charge their phones or other appliances.
1985,"When you think of Vegas. A few points come to mind. Buffet. I looked forward to having the option to choice what to eat vs going to a restaurant undecided of what to have. Its okay if your doing things on your own. Families, is another key point. Kids don't often appeal to what adults marinade their pallets with. Suggestion; incorporate some of the non hot spot gambling areas of the casino and set up a 100/max seating space for a buffet."
1986,Needs better signs! The hotel is like a maze and due to poor signs didn't get to see all of the facilities. Also tea and coffee facitlities in the room!
1987,"They charge a Fee (resort) as other hotels in Vegas, but in others you are given a coupon book for discounts on meals and games, here only one (well certainly in bad presse cafe) coffee and a free beer if you buy other , breakfast in the room (no big deal)"
1988,"It's an absolute maze, quite corporate in that it lacks any old Vegas charm, and the food and drink is grossly overpriced ($4.50 for a croissant and $5 for a cappucino)"
1989,"We didn't like the smoking in the casino which was far too bright. We were not tempted to gamble because of this. The smoke from the casino also affected walkways to lifts, restaurants and many other facilities. At the pool area on the 4th floor we found the music far too loud to make sitting in the sun a relaxing experience."
1990,Leaving.
1991,"Blackjack tables at 6 to 5. Long walk to elevator, (obviously cannot be changed); Self parking too far away from everything. Valet service would not pull up car on the phone, you have to be present.to get your car...which in turn makes you late for meetings."
1992,"The mattress and pillows on the bed are probably the worst we ever experienced, along with the plumbing.  The sinks and tubs would gurgle at random times of the night.  If someone was taking a bath while you were taking a shower the shower would not drain and you risk a chance of it overflowing."
1993,"The WiFi was slow and didn't work sometimes, also the breakfast options were minimal.
One thing that i didn't like was in the morning every now and then the room service would come knocking on the door."
1994,hotel lobby looked very drab compared to the rest of the hotel and checking in and out was a bit of a chore.
1995,Rooms need a mini fridge for my stuff..The refreshments that the mini bar was stock with was wack....U guys should go crazy be the first. ..to have the guests customize their frig when making There reservation
1996,"I did not have a bad experience. Although I did attend Tao night club and there was a bouncer who was very rude and i don't remember his name but he didn't have to speak in a disrespectful way to those who are being nice and cooperative. It just seemed like he didn't care or want to be there, so he just shouldn't because people are spending money there and wanting to have a good time. I understand if he acted that way towards someone who was uncooperative."
1997,"Crazy trek to the guest rooms. Seriously, we had to get in one elevator, then down unbelievably long walk way to another unbelievably long walkway then into another elevator. The funny part is after we got in figured out we would pass new guests coming in with the same bewildered look on their faces. We were traveling with my father who is very able bodied, but still we had to walk him back to his room so he wouldn't get lost. I would go as far as to say this was definitely a design flaw. I would also have expected the filtration system in this high end resort to have been better...it will take me days to recover from  the nicotine exposure!"
1998,"Been wake up by Noise at 5am,like someone use tools fix wall,but it 5am! Except that, it good hotel to stay in Vegas."
1999,Paid extra for room with view of the strip but got air conditioning units none of the rooms face the strip ... However we were given a refund when we complained
2000,The design the construction quality level the decoration and finishes throughout on one hand and the way everything is happening by itself.
2001,"This hotel only cares about money. If you simply receive a shipment, you have to pay at least $10 no matter how small, plus another $10 to deliver to your room. If you touch beverages on the table outside minibar, it will automatically be charged without notifying you. Also, there was a small issue with my credit card (even though the first night was paid) they said no check in until you fix it now, so I had to call my bank while standing at front desk to fix it. We requested a crib and they didn't deliver it claiming we put a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign, which we didn't. After two days from checkout, they charged me $75 mysteriously, and when I emailed them about it, they ignored the email. Button line, customer service is not a priority with this hotel."
2002,"I was charged for many items in the mini bar and the only two drinks
taken out were coke PRODUCTs for the week I was there. So I felt really
taken advantage of. I still look back at my bill you sent and am very
disappointed that next year I will be finding another New Favorite
place to stay."
2003,The security at the main entrance and outside  the hotel were very rude. If this business is based on tourism they might want to consider other employment. Not good for business.
2004,"It is so difficult to navigate the second floor.  Even with the signs and the map, the walking was arduous and frustrating.  For your older guests, there should be more direct routes to amenities."
2005,Nothing
2006,"Not enough lighting in the room, especially the bathroom but not a major problem."
2007,I didn't win big at the casino :( other than that it was perfect!
2008,"My husband and I were guests. In the resort fee were coupons...one coupon for a 8 oz. coffee, none for my husband, and the coffee size was not the Coffee Shop's regular serving size which was 12oz. Coupons should be for both guests of the room. I thought this was a cheap gesture."
2009,The staff they are completely ride especially the last day. When checking out I waited for the bellboy for more thn 45 minutes and he didn't come. So I had to bring down 3 huge pieces of luggage by myself across the hotel which I had to be lk a very long distance and use 2 elevators.
2010,"I had to take a lot of elevators to get to my room, and it was a long walk from the suite to the parking lot."
2011,"There was almost nothing included in the resort fee. Only a free coffee which you get anyway when you gamble. For this high fee you could expect to get free access to the spa which was not the case.
A bottle of water in the room was charged with $5!"
2012,The suite I had booked especially for New Years Eve and had paid a premium rate for was not available . This was to be the highlight of our trip. We were put in another similar suite but with no view . We were very disappointed. We were then moved the next day to our suite but that was not the same.
2013,Have nothing bad to say at all.
2014,"The internet was spotty, went down a lot, and was extremely slow. This was a major problem since I was here for a trade show on business.
the restaurant Tintoretto was the worst one we ever ate at. Spaghettio's in a can taste better with no exaggeration. We loved all the restaurants in St marks sq."
2015,"Room was not cleaned in 4 days, even after complaining! 
Shower kept flooding the bathroom.
Needs some TLC to bring it up to standard. 
Long check in check out ques"
2016,"Every morning we got breakfast to the resort. It was a basic breakfast with eggs, fried potatos, and a sliced tomato.
Day 1, i was being asked on the phone how would we want our eggs. I asked for well done omletes (during pregnancy you cant eat raw eggs and you need to fry/cook them). The woman on the phone said the it wil come plain. I agreed.
I wish i would take a photo of the potatos, so i could show you how greasy they were....
My wife is pregnant, so in the first morning she couldnt stand the smell and didnt eat anything.
The second, morning we asked for well done omletes again, but to have the breakfast without any potatos. The woman on the phone said that they cant serve any omletes. I was a bit confused because the last breakfast we had, included omletes.
 She said that whoever took my order the last time should have not done this but she will do again for the last time. I agreed. I asked again to not get any potatos in our breakfast, and she agreed. We got omletes and we got it with fried potatos. I called the desk again and asked for the breakfast to be replaced and after 40 (!) minutes we got a new one. By that time ny wife lost her appetite and gave up on breakfast.
Third and last morning.  We had a flight to catch. We got up early and i called the desk to order the breakfast. This time i ordered fried aggs and asked it to be well done with no potatos. We got it pretty quickly (it was very early in the morning) and got it with no potatos, but gotpretty raw  scrambled eggs. I called the desk again, told the lady on the phone that we asked it to be well done, and that i want it to be replaced, but we are on a hurry so we need it as fast as they can. We got it after 25 minutes which is completely fine. I asked the guy who brought the breakfast if the eggs are well done, and he told me the he ensure that its well done as i asked for. As he left the room we sat down to eat the breakfast and found out that it is raw again."
2017,"Impossible to get breakfast in the room; you have to go down to the casino to have it and it's a long way.
One phone out of two was out of service.
Considering the price of the room, the overall service is not what one can expect."
2018,"Breakfast delivered late twice
Incorrect breakfast delivered
Inclusive breakfast has limited options
Check in line moved slowly"
2019,"Some very poor attitudes by security on lift patrol   Some were great whilst others were just rude and lacked interest in their job   One guy was so rude and condescending to other patrons it was disgraceful.  He appeared to enjoy his power of access to the lifts and just putting people down.  There are ways of doing your job and insulting people with a smirk on your face is not one of them!   Poor form
Also took 2 hours to change rooms when ours lost power!   2 hours for keys to come up 12 floors!!!!"
2020,"There were a lot of dust on the sofas in the rooms.Not good for someone with allergies.It was very uncomfortable for a member of our group.
The hotel need to do something about these sofas."
2021,I really  enjoyed staying there but my only concern is that on new years day all the hotels around us did not allow ppl who don't have rooms in the hotel to come in for safety reasons ... i did not see that in venetian
2022,"Housekeeping was really poor over the New Year period- they never pitched to clean the room and were full of excuses and rude when we complained
A half eaten meal was left in the corridor for two days a few doors down
The arrivals area was so chaotic when we arrived that we eventually. opted to park ourselves and handle our own bags
The resort was very congested during our entire visit- shopping is a big part of the Venetian so they didn't have the same restrictions in place on outsiders that we saw at other resorts
Cigarette smoke smell was pervasive even on the non-smoking 21st floor"
2023,No coffee maker in room to have fresh coffee. Inconvenient to go down to have a just a cup. Forced to have in room service and breakfast not as good when in a restuarant
2024,"No facility to make a cup of coffee in the room. No room in bar fridge to add personal items. Long queues for checking in and concierge desk, but was busy time of year."
2025,The rooms were poorly maintained and not cleaned properly. We had to switch to different rooms twice. Way worse than the Bellagio. We were comped the stay due to the bad experience. Would've been very unhappy if I had to pay for such hotel room. Would never stay at the Venetian again.
2026,Nothing :)
2027,"Internet was on and off all the time. Strip view (surcharge) was basically pool view, don't pay for it. Rooms are very noisy. No isolation - you can here all the cars and trucks and screams from the pool side."
2028,Nothing
2029,There is not buffet espiecialy for breakfast

2031,Nothing.
2032,Poor parking. Had to shuttle to vehicle.
2033,Access to the spa should be free. $35 per night for resort fee should be able to cover that!
2034,Smoking in casino area. Need better maps in rooms and in facilities. Very confusing to find your way around.
