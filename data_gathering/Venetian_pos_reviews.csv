1,Lovely big room. View of Mirage Hotel from Room in Venezia Tower. Very comfy bed. Friendly staff.   Pool towels. Denny’s near hotel so cheap breakfast option. Gondolas looked amazing.
2,Central to the Mirage where we bought Boys to Men concert tickets in advance.  My husband liked it and would return.  The Yardbird & Deminico'swere wonderful.  The stores  were great!

4,"We stayed at Palazzo tower suits. The room is big with seating area and bathroom has a tub, a shower and restroom."
5,It was on the strip
6,"Lovely hotel and great beautiful room. Cleaned perfectly. In the bathroom, the maid carefully arranged in a row all my tubes and bottles. For those who care, the hotel has a large and functional gym with a variety of exercise machines! Pleased with the free Valet Parking, when you give the keys to the Valet and he drives away the car. When you need to drive the car to the hotel door. Very convenient because this saves you from wandering around the huge Parking lot looking for his car."

You have all what you can expect from a 5* hotel

16,A Pot of coffee from room service for 4 cups was $27 and I made the mistake of ordering 2 pots..  Didn't have coffee delivered again.  How about coffee makers in the room.  We won't even discuss my steak delivered for $88.00.
17,The room size and its decoration: fabulous !!
18,coffee machine in the room would be nice

Room was spacious."
20,"Loves the bed & pillows - very comfy! Nice bathroom amenities. Beautiful, large bathroom overall! 3 TVs in the suite - seemed over the top but nice! Loved the automatic sheers & curtains. Nice touch that you can open & shut them from the bed. Felt like a high roller here even though I didn't gamble! Would've liked a coffee maker in the room - that's my only complaint."
21,"This was the absolute best hotel we have stayed in. The hotel is very large and lots to do without even stepping out onto the strip. The room was very clean, very comfy and very roomy. The staff were all so friendly and would highly recommend this property."
22,Bed was big and bath was good
23,The hotel property felt safe; excellent security and service. The elegant style of the hotel provided the perfect place for my wedding.

25,Everything lovely & clean!  Staff very helpful!
26,"Large spacious room, great location on the strip and fantastic character to the hotel. Plush bathroom and really comfy, huge bed."

31,Front desk agent who checked us in was extremely accommodating. Offered us an upgrade at a discounted rate.
32,"This is the 2nd time I have stayed at this beautiful facility.
Beautiful amenities - luxurious bedroom and bathroom

Separate sitting room with desk area with multiple electrical outlets
Wi-Fi fast and stable.
Front desk staff helpful and welcoming even though I booked through a 3rd party.
Bell staff - efficient and timely.
Onsite restaurant experience - delicious meals, more affordable than expected."
33,Very nice bedroom
34,Bed was amazing and so comfy!!!! I wish I could bring the bed home with me. The hotel is absolutely worth your penny! Though we only stayed one night but it's the best decision we ever made during our honeymoon trip.
35,"Good location 
Suite was big"
36,"Spacious room and bathroom, comfortable beds, helpful staff."
37,"The room up grade to top floor, awesome, beautiful."
38,"When you book a room at the Venetian, you get a suite, in fact every room is a suite and that, makes you feel like money well spent.  I've stayed at the Venetian few times and it never disappoints.  I will come back."
39,The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was excellent
40,The room was incredibly comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful. Restaurants and shops on the property were great. Good location on the Vegas strip.
41,One of the nicest hotels on the strip. Excellent restaurants. Staff were very helpful. Would definitely return to this hotel.
42,"The hotel is over the top. I think it suits couples rather than a group of friends as it's ""trying"" to be very classy and in a romantic style. The casino was great and huge, but very classy and a bit sleepy in oppose to the casino's I've seen in other hotels, which might be a good or bad thing depends on what you're looking for. We've booked a suite with two queen beds, which was ok, but bed should be king size if you're looking for maximum comfort. The bathroom was huge and comfy, this is where I spent most of my evening when got ready to go out."
43,"The suite room was wonderful, like having your own mini apartment in Vegas bar kitchen facilities but who would want to cook with so many great eateries on hand?!
The beds (which are very high if you are short!) were exceptionally comfortable. Fabulous tvs in the sunken sitting room, bedroom and even bathroom. The sitting area was very relaxing and large with small dining table and desk. The wired internet was excellent, I didn't even mind having to do some work I had with me in such a lovely environment! Electronic blinds and curtains a great touch to the large picture windows
The bathroom was exceptional and the most comfortable bath I have ever soaked in (be sure to treat yourself to some bath goodies). Large walk in shower, separate WC and a dedicated hair/make up area and double sinks, in marble
We had a super view from floor 23 looking out over the strip (Mirage to left and Treasure Island to right and straight through to Red Rock Canyon).
The casino is very airy and well laid out.
Complimentary wheelchair hire was much appreciated and the hotel was very easy to navigate with a wheelchair.
Highly recommend eating at Grand Lux (sister to The Cheesecake Factory)"
44,Love the cleanliness and size of our room. Love crib and little condiments they provide for our baby.
45,Basically everything. Good experience started with the spacious 14 storied car park-Free of charge for hotel guests. This was the first indication that the management consider all guest requirements and every other aspect followed. Checking was in the traditional manner where we were queuing up for registration but it went super-fast. Staff was outstandingly polite and helpful. The hotel is very well secured. Professional security personnel guarantee that only the registered guest get access to residential towers and guest facilities. Remember to have your key card with you. Security will not allow you to reach elevators leading to rooms if you do not have the key in hand. I booked a Luxury Sweet and realized it was fully worth the money the moment I opened the door. The sweet was beyond all my expectations and imaginations and was simply glamorous. You find top notch restaurants in the restaurant row and grand canal shoppe itself is an experience.
46,This place was absolutely amazing! The rooms are gorgeous and everything else is pretty awesome too. We won $4700 on a buffalo machine! What more could we ask for.. this was a luxury place I never thought I would be able to stay in.. I will definitely be back!!
47,"Venetian channel is amazing, especially light. Very nice bed."
48,The room was lovely and spacious.
49,Lobby and the shops/canal
50,"Beautiful rooms and great value for money. Great location - walking distance to shows, good restaurants. How Venice's St Mark's Sq. was replicated was well done. Beautiful hotel and very well maintained."
51,The opulence and size of the room. It was fantastic for a 3 day stay.
52,"Large room, big beds, free parking, fast wifi."
53,"Amazing hotel with a fantastic architecture mimicing the Italian style nicely. Very polite and enthusiastic staff. Room size was much bigger than expected with a good view on the St. Mark's Campanile tower and the luxuorious pool downstairs.
Had a great time there!"
54,"I like Venetian restaurants, the shopping arcade and rooms. They were excellent during check-out and valet parking"
55,Great location. Very spacious rooms
56,"It’s the Venetian, so you have that going on for you! Located in the strip, largest resort, amazing restaurants, shops, etc... And the fitness centre was absolutely AMAZING! 
And the one thing I would say was truly 5* from the Venetian was their customer relationships. As per the rest of our review we were not happy with the stay at all and they contacted us personally to discuss. Considering they have 7000+ rooms, providing personalised customer support shows that they really care about each and all of their customers."
57,"Everything about this property is exquisite.  if you want to be safe, comfortable and relaxed this is the ultimate place to stay.  Everyone is nice and helpful."
58,"spacious room and big , I mean very big bathroom 
huge lobby 
a dozen staff at counter for check in
casino is busy"
59,"Everything!!!!
Book this hotel every time for an amazing experience. It will take two days to explore this resort on its own before you head into the Vegas strip. 
Don't touch the bar fridge bottles as there are sensors under each base that bill you each time ypu lift a bottle even if you put it back immediately. Management were great though and wiped the minibar bill when we explained this to them. 
No stress with this hotel/casino."

61,"Great location, helpful staff and incredible resort. Loved the spacious room!"
62,"Nice room, plenty of amenities. Good spa experience."
63,"The beds were comfortable,  the suite is spacious"
64,"The hotel is fabulous, one of the most beautiful and charming in the whole LV area. We visited some other famous hotels, but liked our the most. The streets of Venice, St. Marco square and the channels with gondolas are breathtaking; the halls and the winter garden are to die for. The hotel has lots of restaurants and shops, thus you can spend 3 days without leaving the perimeter; it is also connected to another hotel Palazzo, with good long walk for exercise. The rooms are spacious, comfortable beds, large bathroom. Heated swimming pool and Jacuzzi in the winter garden in the courtyard (although in open air, thus a bit chilly in winter) is a nice bonus.  Madam Tussauds' museum is somewhat smaller than expected; it is best to buy tickets in the hotel with the discount as compared to much higher price in the museum.  Large parking with plenty of space. Central location with 10 minutes walk from Bellagio and Caesar Palace..."
65,Bed was a bit too soft but that's just my opinion.   Beautiful room and bathroom.
66,"I have been to Vegas four times and have stayed at the Venetian twice! The luxury, the amenities and the service is second to none. The staff is amazing, the resort is worth every penny, stay here and never stay anywhere else again! The basic suites are amazing, the bathroom alone is worth it!"

98,The room is nice and big

111,"1. Beautifully designed room
2. A light and bright hotel that made you feel happy, many of the Vegas hotels are very dark and focus too much on casino and not enough on the hotel (New York, New York)
3. The hotel and rooms were immaculately clean, credit to the cleaners

119,"Venetian is a grand hotel. It is an architectural gem from inside.  The reception, lobby and other common areas are worth seeing. The rooms were spacious and clean. I found their casino to be the most well lit among the other big names. The food court has many food options especially vegetarian ones. The other hotel Palazzo is connected through the food court and shopping area. There are many dining options. Free valet is available for hotel guests which was very good considering parking is a hassle on the strip."
120,"Bouchon Restaurant and Bakery were excellent.  The macaroons are out of this world.  Luxurious features such as chocolates in satin pouches left on pillow.

145,"Fabulous suite, very large. Superb bathroom."
146,"The bathroom was out of this world even had a tv in it. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, the bed was great and so were the pillows. Cleaned every day with fresh toiletries added daily. Would recommend this hotel"

Thank you."
156,"Excellent hotel and facilities.
Very disappointed with the Casino staff as we travelled with 4 adults aged 21-23 that were constantly harassed for ID and staff were very rude to them all on too many occasions  to the point where it became VERY embarrassing, DO NOT CHOOSE this hotel resort if you are 21-25 as you will not be welcomed.
In addition a large majority of the Casino staff seemed very miserable and it seemed that they did not want to be there.
On a positive note, we met and were served by a very pleasant elderly asian lady (her name escapes me, however she served our table near the kitchen entrance at 10.30am on Sat 15/07/17) in the Lux Grand Cafe, maybe the hotel resort should model there staff on this lovely pleasant member of staff who is a credit to their business  ?"
157,"The beds are so comfortable, I did not want to get out of my bed. rooms are fabulous."
158,"The bedding was excellent, I liked the bathroom as well."
159,"We stayed at this hotel as it's iconic to Las Vegas and it did not disappoint.  The decor was over the top extravagant everywhere you looked there was something to see.  The rooms were very large, but reflective of the cost, restaurants were everywhere and they were open all hours.  We left the hotel at 3.30am and it was like it was still midday outside.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  There were shops everywhere but I would recommend saving your money and going to the Northern Outlet Stores instead.  I would recommend this hotel if you want the full LV experience and were not worried about the expense."
160,"Massive hotel with so much to do, upgrade room to suite view it's worth it, rooms are beautiful and food is good"
161,"Luxury of the room, surroundings, we loved taking dinner in a Mexican restaurant by a Venetian canal, ability to walk around all the hotels to take in the atmosphere"
162,"I loved my trip to Vegas this time round, I'm not a gambler and I found Vegas incredible even for the likes of me not going to gamble. 
The sites were amazing the Venetian hotel where my partner and I stayed was amazing. The pool beds and Tao beach bed rental I thought was extremely expensive for couples and we were residents at the hotel. A reduced price would have been better for couples rentinf. Big groups could have split price so ok for them. This is nout to do with hotel but I felt becos of the volumes of people living in Vegas as well as tourists coming in and out everyday. Traffic is crazy. I felt that the strip especially would really benefit with a bus and taxi lane. I think traffic would flow quicker. 
Overall I had a one of the best holidays ever. Defo stay at the Venetian hotel."
163,Amazing suite for standard room. Great pool. Lots of meal options from budget to fine dining. Stunning casino interior and exterior. Really like how entrance to elevators and pool area are manned and you have to show your room key.
164,The rooms were very spacious and luxurious.
165,Thank you for expert and professional service from your reservation department.  The reviews are that I read are correct and your hotel is outstanding.
166,"everything is near to you, no need to leave the hotel
huge clean rooms (all standard rooms are joiner suites) 
great staff,"
167,"The hotel was nice, and the bed was super comfortable."
168,Suite is standard so you get double the room size compared to most. The staff were fantastic. I had a problem with my credit card so they let me pay a small deposit in cash and told to I sort it in the morning without any fuss. By far the most spectacular inside.
169,"The hotel is classic, timeless and beautiful.  I was very happy to have booked this hotel after arriving and comparing the others in the strip."
170,"The house keeping crew were WONDERFUL! They are so sweet and helpful, they really made you feel like you were on vacation. 
If you like well crafted drinks we defiantly suggest the Dorsey, they are more $$$ but its a fun atmosphere. If you want the best breakfast of your life please go to Yard Bird, their Eggs Benedict and Bloody Mary's are amazing. 
Friendly staff, no complaints at all. It was our wedding weekend and they were all so accommodating."
171,"Big room, great location"

182,"The location is Perfect. It's at the heart of most things though the cosmopolitan has some better in-hotel options I found myself leaving less and staying within the hotel vicinity more than when I stayed at Cosmo. The rooms are spacious and clean, well appointed and they even give you a fridge if you need it (you do need to request it from RS). The mall is grand and a sight to see for anyone traveling to Vegas, however that does make it more crowded. But not outside of convenience.  Restaurant selections are good. There is variety from good to great restaurants cheap options and expensive ones."
183,"Rooms were very spacious, well equipped and comfortable. The location on the Strip, proximity to the Fashion Mall, on-site shops, canals and decor of the Venetian were all incredible. We would stay there again without any hesitation. 
Price is what you pay, value is what you get - the Venetian is not cheap but is great value."
184,The overall ambiance of the hotel was wonderful from the details of architecture down to the accordion player in the lobby was realistic to visiting Italy.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The suites were spacious and the beds comfortable.
185,Location
186,The hotel restaurant food prices were reasonable
187,The size of the rooms. The casino is a much brighter one the rest on the strip. If you are looking for something with a bit more sparkle this is the hotel to stay in.

189,"We loved our luxurious suite, and spacious bathroom. The bed was comfty. Hotel grounds our beautiful."
190,The location was quite central

192,"The room was amazing - large lounge area, bed was comfy & the bathroom was luxurious. 
Staff were friendly & super efficient."
193,"The room was perfect, very clean. Definitely my favorite hotels in Vegas."
194,"the room itself was very pretty and accommodating, the view was okay because we got a window where if you look you just see the roof top. However, the room definitely had a special personality to it and was indeed very pretty."
195,"The location of the property is excellent, on the strip."
196,Location was nice and the room was spacious.
197,"excellent facilities, beautiful interior decorations, wide choice of restaurants and very spacious rooms."
198,The room was very comfortable and the cleanliness was great.
199,Everything from an early check in to a luggage gold made our vacation smooth and fun! The Venetian is  in a class of its own. Never once did we ever think we made the wrong choice. In fact we toured the strip and realized how great of a decision it was to stay at the Venetian. We're humble people from humble upbringings and we were happy with every penny spent!
200,Very convenient almost everything is around.
201,"Very nice and clean room, comfortable and spacious. Very beautiful canals and venetian-style interior. Quick check out."
202,Good hotel and location
203,"The room was massive! We had a king size bed (compfy & clean). The room looked exactly like the advertised pictures! The bathroom was beautiful, it had a separate backlit mirror for the lady's, which was much appreciated! 
The location of the hotel was great, right in the middle of the action, surrounded by many places to eat! 
The shopping is also great, located within the hotel, the offerings are mostly highend stores though, not a lot of variety! BUT if you want bargins you MUST go to North Premium Outlet!! It's a 10-15 minute taxi ride away, and it's worth it!! The savings on brand names such as guess, fossil, Ralph Lauren are crazy!! Such as 50% the entire fossil store, watches, handbags, everything! 
I would certainly recommend this hotel to family & friends!"
204,Huge room as in other reviews! Didnt need to leave hotel as everything under one roof - excellent restaurants and food. Bed was extremely comfy. Bathroom was huge too. Good location and beautiful surroundings.
205,Spacious room and bathroom
206,"Positive
The granduer of the place makes you feel good when u walk in to check in.  The staff at the checkin is efficient n friendly.
Room layout is the best in the strip.  We hv stayed in the Wynn n Ceasar before and we will give Venetian the thumps up.
The food options n restaurent types are excellent.
The location is great as it is easy to get to other hotels n also the bazaars.
Negative
As a hotel guest nothing is free n that makes you feel you are not a guest but a client.  I have to pay for kettle, wifi, indoor swimming pool and gym. 
We are most disappointed with room cleaning.  Socks n underwear on the floor were left as it is n the table n chairs are dusty. We suspect no vacumming is done.  This aspect displease us to a point that if we returned to Vegas again we will look at other hotels.
We hope Venetian will look into this seriously."

208,"Great room quality for the price. Very spacious, clean and nice."

224,The restaurants were great with good service and delicious foods.   The art and decor in the hotel is stunning.  Look up and see beautiful renaissance reliefs and paintings on the ceilings.  The stripview from our room was of the pools and we could watch the volcano erupt across the street at the Mirage.  Cool sight from above.
225,"Rooms were beautiful,clean and the staff was very nice and helpfull. We really did not like the maze and distance we had to navigate to reach our room."

228,"Great location, everything was amazing and impressive."
229,I liked room and cleanness.
230,The room was nice and big. The bed was very comfortable. The resort is huge and can be confusing at times. Plenty of places to eat from less expensive to high dollar restaurant's. Definitely want to go back again sometime when it's warmer. Staff was very helpful and friendly. They make the hotel more enjoyable. Thank you!
231,"The Venetian is THE hotel I always promised myself I would stay at if I visited Vegas - it did not disappoint!
We were given a room on the 25th floor by our very courteous and professional receptionist which turned out to have a partial Strip view. The suite was amazing - spacious, clean and very comfortable. The bed was HUGE and was the most comfortable one I have ever slept in in any hotel in the world!
We loved the free valet parking where we were always treated in a polite and friendly manner.
I was impressed with the cleanliness and upkeep of the rooms and all the public areas outside the casino - something I couldn't say about some of the other hotels we visited during our stay. It seems they take great pride in maintaining things to a very high standard - we even saw decorators in touching up some of the rooms.
Overall The Venetian exceeded my expectations - I would not hesitate to recommend it."
232,"everything is fantastic ,location ,veiw, cleanliness, staff ,interior and exterior of the hotel"

236,"Conveniently located for my work
Good size room"
237,"This building is gorgeous! Every hallway, elevator, every bathroom, the pools, the gym were all immaculate! As soon as I checked in the staff offered a wide variety activities and specials in the hotel and on the strip. The room was nice a cozy and extremely spacious bathroom. For the ladies and the lades that like to do their make-up before a night out, the bathroom had a great vanity space with mirrors and great lighting. One last thing, Uber knew exactly were to pick us up and drop us off every time, very convenient pick-up/drop off locations. I can definitely see my family and friends staying here again."
238,The nicest hotel room and bathroom I've ever stayed in.  Whole resort was wonderful.

The best thing was the hotel has its own shopping mall, and lots of places to eat, so once you enter the hotel you don't need to leave."

243,"The stay at The Venetian was amazing. The hotel itself is super impressive. The staff are all very helpful and friendly and the rooms are incredible. The room itself had a living room, 2 TVs and the beds were incredibly comfortable. There is even a TV in the bathroom! The rooms are quiet as well despite the hotel being in the middle of Las Vegas Blvd.
The hotel is amazing and huge - you can easily get lost in the casino or on the second level shops! But that just means there is a lot to do and see. Overall it's one of the coolest places I've ever stayed in Vegas. Highly recommended."
244,The hotel is stunning. They have thought of every single detail. The staff are all so friendly and helpful everywhere

253,The amount of space in the suites was wonderful and the bathroom was a delight. There was so much to see and do inside the complex comprising the two hotels with shops that we had everything we needed so we ended up never leaving the complex.
254,"The rooms are fabulous set on 2 levels. Large luxurious bathroom, super comfortable bed and a spacious lounge area set 3 steps down from the sleeping area. Televisions in all rooms including the bathroom and a telephone in the toilet!
The hotel is vast with something new to see at the turn of every corner. The Grand Canale shopping area is spectacular and, having been to Venice, this re-creation is just right. The only thing missing is the smell!
The hotel staff generally were very friendly and helpful exactly as you would expect."
255,The restaurants were ok!
256,Location is great
257,"I had ""a situation"" during the night and needed  one room around 3:00am, but had money only for one night due to some circumstances. Hotel offered me super early checkin for small price for view upgrade. Due to fact Venetian was fully booked, they moved me to Palazzo wchich was great."
258,"Extraordinary rooms, a luxurious bed, beautiful shower , simpley amazing place"
259,Almost everything
260,Architecture
261,The Venetian exceeded most if not all my expectations. The only issue I had was check in. I was not allowed to check in early due to room availability and I have always checked in early everywhere else I've stayed. What I liked most was the decor of the room. It was very appealing to the eye.
262,Location.

264,Overall GREAT experience!
265,The staff was extremely friendly! The estimate check in wait was 3 hours but they got us in 30 mins after arrival. Anytime we needed anything the everyone was very helpful from concierges to operations. I usually stay at The Aria or Bellagio but I think The Venetian is my new  favorite! It's in the heart of everything and sooooooooo convenient to get where I need to get. This place is AMAZING from the decor to the comfortable beds! I'd highly suggest this place!

We had an early morning check-in and were given the option of a room straight away on the 12th floor or late afternoon check-in of a higher floor.....we took the 12th floor that had views of the Venetian Pool, some of the strip, and the mountains in the background. The suite was beautiful, very opulent, classy and roomy. The king sized bed was amazing and we slept well on it, the separate lounge area was great and the bathroom was also very classy.
The is a stocked mini-bar in the room but no where to put your own drinks to cool.
The hotel was just marvellous, the ceilings are decorated with Sistine chapel style paintings, the Grand Canal Shoppes had sky painted ceilings simulating outdoor areas at and the floors were even a fancy design to catch the eye. The Casino is vast but very open and well decorated."

294,"Room was large and clean.  We upgraded for an additional charge for a room with a view 
Room service was excellent"
295,The spa was fantastic! The fact that with a massage booking you get all-day access to all the spa facilities makes the massage prices actually pretty reasonable.
296,"Everything, it is an amazing hotel located perfectly in the strip where everything is happening. The rooms are great and the best you can get. The basic room is huge so in my opinion you don't even need to upgrade and you can save this money to the casino :)"

Shopping mall was huge and we were lucky to have a suite away from the casino with having kids with us. Would recommend if you don't mind paying over the odds for everything once you are there - but that's Vegas for you!
400,The hotel is amazing! The grand canal section is the best! So beautiful! Good shops and restaurants. I loved everything! You will want to stay forever in this hotel!

The view was great even when not purchasing extra for a City Strip View. The mountainside, skylines, other buildings, and golf course were all nice to look at. The entire room, and resort for that matter, was sparkling clean. I loved the atmosphere and convenience of having all the shops around, including a Walgreens for random necessities. The elevators were also nicely organized so they did't overcrowd."

448,"Pure Luxury, great rooms and pools, restaurants in the complex were also great.
Why leave the hotel in 100 degree heat and be accosted by beggars all day and night?
Would visit the hotel again, would we visit Las Vegas again??????"
449,The hotel was really beautiful - a holiday in itself.  Everything is spotless and luxurious.  The beds are very comfy and the rooms are spacious and sumptuous.  Pay for a view room and ask for a high floor to see the city lights.  Allow time in your trip to spend in the hotel as it is huge and worth exploring.
450,"Although its a large hotel, they got us through check in and check out quickly, efficiently and, most importantly, with a smile.  Excellent  and very glamorous facilities.  The suites were amazing and so comfortable!  This is a hotel that works very hard to make sure their guests are well catered for and have a great time.  The final check out with the wonderful Sylvia ensured we left wanting to come back!  It far outshines the dated money-grabbing Bellagio - well done!"

Carlos showed up with the glasses. Thanks!
The bellman Andres was very helpful. 
Joseph at the front desk was very patient, informative and accommodating. A great employee. 
The facilities are so very clean, the bed was awesome and the view was great!
The Lux cafe was a great offer of food later at night, many tasty choices. Delmonicos is first rate. The many shops enable you to not even need to exit the facility. The concierge was great at making my dinner and entertainment arrangements. 
And, of course, a TV in the bathroom makes taking care of your personal necessities a better endeavor."
561,"Not much- wouldn't stay there again. Okay to be fair, the lobby decor is very nice: but it smells of smoke so unless you like smoke- you can't enjoy it."

Then I go up to my room, and it is the most beautiful suite I could imagine. I don't remember paying for a suite, but just a standard room. Again, blown away. Then the hotel really speaks for itself when it comes to all other things.. restaurants, pool, spa, etc. I've been to Vegas 3 times, this was by far my best experience."

The hotel Amenities are plentiful as are the number of pools.
The location is great, right on the strip and next door to Hurrahs with the cheap seat Black Jack Tables.

2. The resort was bright, clean and the food and beverage options were excellent.
3. Convenient and comfortable when relaxing."
2047,"The standard suite is very nice. Of course the hotel is majestic, but perhaps a bit too chaotic due to the Grand Canal Shop Center, while other hotels seems to have a more ""intimate"" environment."

2108,I liked the fact that everything is made for you to have fun and confort for your hollidays. nothing is missing.
2109,"Great location, excellent service for a large scale hotel. This is a large hotel and very crowded. Use common sense. Avoid checking in during primetime to avoid a long wait. Taxi lines are long. Ask the curb side service for a town at or limo if you have a large group. It might be a few bucks more but you'll save a lot of time if that is important. There is staff everywhere and always helpful."

2116,Rooms look nice and the gym was excellent.
2117,"What can I say, this hotel has got 7100 rooms, 19 restaurant, casino, 5 pools and 80 stores of shopping. We felt almost royal staying here. The room was amazing, we ordered breakfast in the room and it was even better. We went out to eat steak at delmonicos restaurant in the hotel, and it was really the best service and the best steak we have ever had. They made us feel special. The pool areas are really nice in the Las Vegas june heat. free parking, but extra resort fee for wifi and use of pools. Would recommend it to anyone"

I had a 5th floor room which looked out onto the back of another building and air conditioning units and normally I would have complained but the window treatments are so beautifully done and effective that I never needed to open them so the view didn't matter.  First class accommodations and quite spacious.  Comfy beds, nice linens and well appointed amenities;  3 tv's, adequate lighting, remote controlled draperies and a separate toilet area and makeup table.  The canal shoppes are attached to the property and lead to the sister property, the Palazzo."

2124,The Venetian is a city within itself!
2125,"The Venitian has it all!!  Amazing world class restaurants, shopping, nightclubs, three pools and superior service.  Marble everywhere you look and extremely clean!  Oh and the gambling is stellar!!"

2128,The hotel has everything inside from shopping to casinos to eateries to night club to Vegas shows ... Name it and you have in the hotel
2129,Flight was early in the a.m.(8:30) and late departure 10 at nite.  Hotel permitted early checkin and instead of 11 checkout time granted our stay till 6 p.m. Everyone was hospitable.
2130,Beds were very comfortable and clean.
2131,Nothing..the checking in process and hospitality  at reception was so bad that we opted not to stay with them even after paying them

Room was amazing - could not fault it at all.  Beautiful big bathtub - great for relaxing after a very hot day in Las Vegas. Would recommend for a luxurious stay."
2141,"Customer Service was fantastic.  After check-in, we hiked up to our room and the key did not work in the door.  Rather than having to go all the way back down to the front desk, the manager had security meet me at another (upgraded) room with new keys.  Well done."
2142,"The hotel and its complex reflect the disproportion of Las Vegas.
Our suite was big, very comfortable and well equipped, with a nice view over the hotel complex and the city. Bedding a little soft for us. Huge state-of-the art bathroom.
In-room breakfast was served on time, according to our request, and warm.

2149,Rooms are large clean & comfortable
2150,"As soon as I walked in the hotel I was treated like a million bucks. Front desk was very respectful and helpful. When we got to our room and open the door I was amazed, the room was immaculate and luxurious. I wanted to stay in it all day and live there. 
We were fortunate to get free breakfast with our stay and not only that, it was also brought to our room. Oh, I was in heaven cause that enabled me to stay in the room longer. The staff was excellent. I recommend and definitely will be staying at this hotel  again."
2151,Bed
2152,"Has everything you could ever want or need. Pool parties, high end shopping, chill out bars, beautiful decor, excellent casino! Also prime location right on the strip close to the Caesar's, the Bella too etc."
2153,Only Location....
2154,The suite was fantastic - everything that we had hoped for. Better value for money than other 5-star hotels (e.g. bellagio). We had breakfast delivered to the room every day
2155,I mean its the venitian so definitely the luxury
2156,"Wonderful staff. Not a bad one in the bunch. Excellent in-suite
breakfasts. The bed felt like we were at home. Beautifully decorated
suite. Where do they find such wonderful employees?"
2157,I was very impressed with the way that the customer service desk was able to quickly assist clients with the check in process. Move the long line along quickly without having much of a wait.

was great! 103 degrees outside so it was a relief!"
2159,"Location, room, internet wifi, comfort staff, and service."
2160,"The rooms are amazing and extremely opulent. The bathroom is enormous - the walk-in shower is big enough for 2 - should you fancy it!! The beds are super king sized and really comfortable. The pool area is amazing too, but you need to be an early riser to get a sunbed - there was only 1 pool open and a lot of people wanting to sunbathe when we stayed there. It's really worth staying here - they will be a hard act to match should we go back to Vegas"
2161,the suite was huge and very comfortable. The location of the hotel was excellent. Has its own shopping center and many eateries.
2162,Spacious hotel. Pure luxury. Cleanliness of rooms very good.

2167,It's located on the strip
2168,"Took my friend on his first trip to vegas, this is the best hotel yet....staff is everything and so is appearance. Club Tao is also the best nightclub in Las Vegas  also hotel has multiple places to eat and hangout"
2169,"Maybe the best stay I had in all my trips.
Indeed we had a Deluxe Suite at a really good early book rate which made an extremely good Value for Money. When I wanted to add 3 more days , later on , we could not get a similar rate (it was more than double the price)"
2170,"Stayed here for 4 amazing nights. Bed is big and comfortable. Staff is very friendly except the concierge was not very helpful to me when I was looking for a tailor. Also our room had plumbing issues with the shower not draining and one of our sink faucets squirted all over the place. And there was this horrible noise coming from l The plumbing of one of our sinks that would drive me crazy! We had free breakfast every morning and although the menu was limited, it was delicious! Facilities are top notch at this hotel :)"
2171,King suite with a view was spectacular.
2172,The room size and layout was great. Amenities in the immediate area were excellent.
2173,"Love our deluxe room, pool! Check-in was quick, really like the casino,
I especially enjoy the polite and positive staffs at the hotel. While we
were waiting to be checked in this chinese staff came to us and asked if
we are checking in and what are our check-in initials. I think he
thought we needed translation. That was sweet :)."
2174,The room amenities and staff were wonderful.
2175,"Luxuary Hotel where the impossible seems affordable< service is excellent, excellent in-equivalent quality for an affordable price< U have more , much more for U re money when compared to other Hôtels I did<"

Celebrating our 30th's beautiful location mid of strip.

2179,"Really great, not over-prized Hotel at an ideal location of the strip. The all-suite concept if the hotel is fabolous. Great day club."
2180,"loved the location, facilities, entities provided. It has so many scenic places throughout the hotel , it took almost half a day for us just to see it. Took was very comfortable and the service was good. The only thing which did not really make sense was even after paying so much, we did not have a complimentary breakfast included and they charged us for cutlery when asked !!!"
2181,"* Location

* Room with the Strip view - great!

2184,"Our rooms were impressive.  We liked the suite with the step down living area complete with a sofa,  dining table and another Television .  The two queen size beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was excellent with a separate shower and toilet along with a double sink. The hotel had many reStaurants as well as magnjficent shopping and gaming. It was a lot of fun for the whole family"
2185,"The bedrooms where so clean and plush.
Loved the fantasy element of the whole resort.
Breakfast deal through bookings was good value"
2186,"My mate is still raving about the King Room w/ view accommodations and has already told me that on our trips to Las Vegas in the future she doesn't want to stay anywhere else, but The Ventian. I agree."
2187,The Overall Experience was Just Nothing less than Wonderful ! The Venetian is Such a Beautiful Place to Relax By the Pool And Not To Mention The Fabulous Restaurants  Great Shopping And Memorable Gondola Ride! We Will Be Back!
2188,We loved this hotel and what it had to offer. The pool area is brilliant we always got a sun bed. The gym was great we used it each morning. Breakfast was brought to our suite each morning and laid out on our dinning table. Couldn't fault anything about our stay
2189,"Our Bella Suite was absolutely gorgeous and comfortable and a delight to stay in.  Two of us friends stayed in one suite and our other two friends were in an adjoining suite, so it made it a blast to be there together and we played lots of bridge in addition to running around in town.  I got sick however I needed the concierge to advise on where the closest CVS pharmacy was so my out of town Dr. could send a prescription.  The concierge told us it was just across the street so we walked over there to find that that CVS has no pharmacy and my prescription got sent to another pharmacy that was a $30 taxi ride!  I was also unable to go out for dinner or to the show we had purchased tickets for that night, so I stayed and had room service send up hot tea and a bowl of miso soup.  That tea and soup cost me $44-----and that made me feel even worse!  It would be nice if the hotel provided the cure rig coffee maker that makes one cup of tea or coffee at a time instead of requiring room service to bring  a coffee or tea up or the guest to have to go down stairs to buy coffee and bring it back to the room. For us it was a 21 floor elevator ride, a very long hallway ---because we were at the far end of it --- and the plain coffee was $10 and cold by the time you got it back to your room where there was no way to heat it.  I guess I should've written this last part where I vent my frustrations in the box below, but didn't realize you were providing a place for comments about negative thoughts. Sorry."
2190,"Everything; free valet parking, clean rooms, nice location and view (in the middle of strip street), friendly staffs, the mall linked to the hotel is excellent. We loved almost everything at The Venetian."
2191,"The room/suite was great, ambiance of facility first class, and the friendly staff accommodated all our requests. Be prepared for long walks to get from location to location in the hotel."
