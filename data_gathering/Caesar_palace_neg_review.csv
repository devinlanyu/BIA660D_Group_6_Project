where to start.ok first when I booked I opted for breakfast plan  to be told on arrival at hotel we had a 10$ each day only to spend in certain shops as if they where to give a breakfast to everybody (even though I had paid for it on booking it)the hotel would close????.2nd the room was a mess on check in.3rd sockets hanging of walls I took pictures.4th shower area when showering the water was coming out onto the floor as it was a wet room and the lean to the drain wasn't right I also slipped 1 night.over all felt after all my years with booking .com I was mislead and disappointed."

we were paranoid about moving/touching mini bar and snacks. Were told that everything was weighted and we would be charged just for moving something."

I would not return. Our stay was a nightmare from start to finish.
Huge line up to check in if you could get near the entrance with your car. offered express check-in but tried to use and could not because had two rooms. Extra charges for everything ! suppose to include breakfast did not ! It was expensive - $17 US for a glass of wine"

TV jammed and had to call engineer delaying getting to sleep for an hour
Blinds stopped working
Coffee machine did not work
Sink plug jammed and unable to let water drain
All these issues for an upgraded room.
Room look a little dated and tired"

The toilet paper is rough, there is no cotton swabs or complementary water or toothbrush.  When I travel around the world to 5star hotels I expect water. Toothbrush and toilet paper that doesn't scar with every swipe."

Staff was very rude. Everyone in general was rude! The room decor looked old and it smelled like stale cigarettes! There was absolutely no view! We had got the forum suite so I don’t know if all of these suites view is a wall out the window! Carpet was very dirty! We stayed at Sams Town the 3 nights prior and their B suite was BY FAR cleaner and WAY more modern! Our expectations were REALLY high after staying there! Will not return to caesars palace EVER AGAIN!"

The fact that there was a kurig but no coffee.  The bottle of water in the room was $7.00...that is shameful! I understand they want you in the casino...where I could get water for free, but it would break the bank to actually have a couple of these amenities in the room.
We recieved 10.00 off a night for not having our room serviced...but only after the 1st nite...why not all the nites we were there. Drinks were outrageously priced...we were in NV  after all!"
7,"눉
Check in was really slow. Ok, there was also a new girl who checked us in and had to ask for help with checking us in, provided us with some wrong information regarding breakfast as well. The room is actually very worn out. There were 3 bathroom lights at the sink area and 1 didn’t work. The bathroom had a really bad ordour, didn’t complain about it...figured I’m not sleeping In there. The bath towels are really worn out"
8, yellow and tattered. I expect more from a 5 star hotel. I stayed in the Augustus tower.

Pricey amenities"
10," couldn't use the mini frig without a $25 fee. ""Smokey"" lobby, hallways and restaurants, could have filtered the air better."
11,"눉
The Chinese/Asian food restaurant is very bad and quality of of food is horrible."
12,"눉
The lack of clarity regarding the room food credit
The wifi strength and connectivity was terrible"
13,"눉
Overrated. Service was not satisfactory. At the check in all of the three of our suit cases were delivered to our room dirty and scratched. Place itself looks dingy inside (but, to be honest, so does every other hotel in Vegas, cause they look like they are in need of renovation since the 80-s). Room is ok and looks recently renovated, but the cleaning services were disappointing: housekeeping did not wipe a sticky table, forgot a dirty towel on the top of one of our suite cases, did not provide us with new set of paper cups for coffe after throwing away the old ones. There was alcohol in a mini bar and zero glasses to drink it from. New towels did not feel fresh. The information on booking.com regarding the price of parking was misleading: the booking said that there is a parking that costs 10$ (they did not indicate that 10$ is per 12 hours of parking only). And they did not warn that Caesars charges 23$ per 12 hours of parking."
14,"눉
10 min walk from car park to reception with luggage not offered porter service to or from room although it is availble we were not told this until check out .Iwalk with a stick .No free wi fi .charge for in room tea and coffee  .We stayed here as a treat what a disappointment !"

Bathtub not available as promised. Staff seemed untrained and unhelpful for the most part. Bell and valet staff were prompt and friendly. Casino was awful."
16,"눉
The smoke smell you can’t escape when trying to go anywhere inside or when you are just plain lost😳😏😂."
17,"눉
Way over priced at the restaurants and bars... no refrigerators in the room. You had to pay $20 a day for one. Having a little thing such as a refrig would have offset the high prices at the hotel eateries!!"
18,"눉
Very expensive to eat drink and for a room is over rated when you have to pay to have Mimi fridge opened.  Never had to pay this before!!!
Shower door leaked too."
19,"눉
There was a coffee maker in our room but no coffee.  
I realize when valet is busy they are stressed but no need to be rude."
20,"눉
They must pump Febreze into the HVAC system, I'm allergic to those products. So I had headache, sinus issues, and breathing issues. It wasn't as noticeable in my room, but still affected me there too."
21,"눉
This is definitely not an hotel for kids, we were stuck at a distant location in the hotel. there was a 'smoking' scent almost everywhere, especially on the ground floor where you have to walk to get out of the hotel or even to hotel restaurants. .  I think a fair warning should have been put up."
22,"눉
The same that I dislike about most american hotels"
23, no breakfast.
24,"눉
After our first night at the hotel, we discovered our hotel door didn't latch fully each time, even though it sounded and looked closed. We woke up that first morning to discover our wallets had been stolen (while we were asleep in the room!) and learned the term ""door pusher."" The security officer told us we weren't the only people to have our rooms broken into that night. The hotel let us change to a bigger room in a different tower, but only comped us for the first night, which was not nearly as valuable as the money we lost, nor made up for the inconvenience of being in Las Vegas for 3 days without access to any money. We also learned the hotel only has cameras in some towers (so avoid Julius tower), and doesn't require a keycard to access hotel floors, meaning anyone can lurk around the hotel hallways at anytime."
25,"눇
Ordered room service (pizza) and they brought it sooner than estimated and brought place settings, fresh Parmesan, red pepper flakes.  My son felt like we were celebs!  Caesars is just always good. We had so much fun walking around the shops the next day.  I’d valet next time as self parking is quite a ways from some of the towers/rooms and we walked quite a ways with our luggage. Overall, great stay!"
26,"눉
Check in staff was unhelpful. The valet parking gets full, so you are not sure if you can park or not. First room had broken glass all over it. Second room was very loud. Pool got closed for an event. The air in the hotel smells bad on our floor."
27,"눉
Not enough loungers at pool. Towels left on unoccupied beds for hours while people look for loungers. Unfair as resort fees are high ..."
28,"눉
Bad they withhold £100 per night and it’s only credited back 3 working days later."
29,"눉
cleaning crew entering room and cleaning when we were gone despite do not disturb on door, supervisor never showed up and offered explanation or assurance it would not happen again
limited late night food court"
30,"눉
No exhaust fan in bathroom means more odor. You couldn’t use the little fridge in the room unless you paid extra...only two people can have free WiFi in room....air conditioning wasn’t great....and for over $350.00 a day I would have expected more. Also charged us $23.00 a day for our valet parking...again, would have thought the room price was high enough."
31,"눉
Casino floor was smaller than I expected, but there's so much more to Cesar's Palace than the casino."
32,"눉
Can't find anything to write here.  Everything was wonderful."
33,"눉
I am not a fan of the pay snacks and drinks in the room, MiniBar. At this location, if you even lift the item, you are charged. If you put something in their fridge, you will be charged $25.xx. They do not express this to you at check-in. Ne free internet here. The good price on the room becomes not so great when they add a ""mandatory resort fee"" of about $44.xx. Food anywhere on site will be at a premium. It is a quality hotel with quality pricing"
34,"눉
They charge for internet, and they even have a limit to use it once paid ...15.99 for internet for one day is ridiculous, at Vdara is free and with no conditions..also i find a few stains on the bed comforter that appeared to be blood ..."
35,"눉
The adjoining room- people were smoking and it came through the door.  The check in kiosk was pretty impersonal.  Location of room tower difficult to find (while lugging suitcases)"
36,"눉
When I book the room the picture on booking.com looks like a suite with separated living room, but when I get in the hotel it’s just a simple 2 queen bed room nothing special"
37,"눉
We opted not to get the linen and towels changed in exchange for a ten percent discount for restaurants at Caesars Palace.  However we really didn't enjoy the buffet there so we ate at other restaurants and did not get the 10 percent discount.  Next time I will not make that mistake."
38,"눉
Could have been slighly cleaner. Food spilt in lift was left there all day. Outside had very bad smell from  drains. Room was very clean"
39,"눉
No help with carrying up the luggages.
One of our boxes of nuts was empty and they tried to charge us for changing it.
Advice: always double check your bill.
Online check-in doesn't really work, you still have to queue and takes longer than just immediately go to the counter and check in the old fashioned way."
40,"눉
The instruction of self parking is confusing and we spent almost 40 minutes from parking lots to check-in desk. I used QR code to do self check-in but was prohibited to do by the machine. Therefore, we spent so much time on check-in/ check-out. The room is clean but I do not think it is worth two hundred dollars for one standard room per night"
41,"눉
I’ve stayed many times at Caesars. I stayed in the forum tower. This was a first. It was pretty beat up. When I stay again, I’ll stay in either the Octavius or Augustus towers."
42,"눉
The front desk staff and their flippant attitude.  Never been treated so poorly. Our none smoking room smelled like an ashtray, so much so that no one could stay in the room for two nights while it was being deodorized. Luckily we had a second room for everyone to bunk in, but it was not ideal.  To compensate us we were refund 1 day’s resort fee.  We are one of many guests and they make we knew it and that they simply didn’t care."
43,"눉
Valet was full and only open to seven star members so had to park in the self park lot and walk through the whole casino to check in. Then we checked in at a electronic kiosk since the line was so long only to be given a room in the tower by the parking garage. So we walked all the way back across the casino with our bags (no one offered to take them), finally get to our room, try to make a cup of coffee and find out it’s $13, for coffee!!!"
44,"눉
The proces at the restaurants were very high and we did not like the food in some  of the restaurants"
45,"눉
Pricey early check-in fee. Also would have liked to be able to use the fridge in the room for personal use without being charged."
46,"눉
It’s possibly the NV laws but I had to use elevator to go smoke on the Casino floor (non-smoking rooms not advised for us silly smokers, quitting advised). That’s the only minor gripe"
47,"눉
The long delays upon arrival and departure. More assistants are needed to help people to use check in and check out procedures in the machines.
Also valet parking for half an hour was 20$ which should be either less or complimentary for customers."
48,"눉
Upon arrival I asked about reservations for the buffet bacchanal.  I stated that our Anniversary was the next day and asked if we needed reservations.  I was told no reservations were excepted and that it would be a short wait of about 20 minutes.  The next day my husband and I went to the restaurant about 6:00pm.  As we approached a women yells mam you can’t go in there!  I was obviously confused and asked her why not.  She said don’t you see the sign it says restaurant closed.  I then said that we were told that the restaurant would be open as I had spoken to the front desk.  She then said that someone bought out the restaurant for the night and not to go to Nobu either.  Needless to say I was very upset as we were celebrating our 31st anniversary and wanted to eat at that specific restaurant.  Shouldn’t the restaurant have separate rooms for parties so that guests can also enjoy their restaurants?  Shouldn’t Caesars have known that the restaurant was going to be closed prior to the day?  Will not return."
49,"눉
Just the parking for checking in."
50,"눉
The room wasn't exactly clean. Could tell either it hadn't been rented in a while or certain areas were missed when dusting. The little details were missed in the cleaning process. And the shower smelled of mildew. Its the details that count when cleaning a hotel like this. Didn't like that you have to pay per device for Wi-Fi. A map of exactly where everything is in the hotel and/or of Las Vegas strip would be nice upon check in. The ""map"" we were given was not suffice. We were first time Vegas visitors and had a hard time navigating through the hotel/casino. Also this website was not clear what view each room had. I had to Google to see what my room was looking at. FYI The Octavious Tower does not face The Belagio Fountains."
51,"눉
No value for money, you pay top rates and water is additional from mini bar. Lower rated hotels provide this for free, along with tea and coffee."
52,"눇
Book the hotel after watching ''Hangover'' movie. Was slightly disappointed with the overall experience. Old furnishings, no water was given and was STILL charge for using the minibar item despite not drinking it. Breakfast is given as credit and have to be use in the property premises. The property has nice appearance, but would benefit if they can improve the inside."
53,"눉
WiFi kept logging me out, outside of windows in bedroom were filthy, food was over priced, pricing was complicated. Never again."
54,"눉
We were surprised there was no shower gel, or at least a bath soap. Our room just had a face bar.  We checked out with a text, but dont have a receipt."
55,"눉
The only downside is the smoking in the casinos. The ventilation is better than it used to be, but still a problem for me."
56,"눉
The first non smoking room we were put in stunk of smoke. We asked to change rooms but of course it was at extra cost. The next room which was identical did not smell of smoke. 
One half of the room was lit up by floor lamp only. When we tried to turn it on it sparked and crackled. We tried a few times and it still sparked and my husband got a small electrical shock so we unplugged it and kept it off for the 5 nights we were there. It meant total darkness apart from 2 bedside lamps. We mentioned the faulty lamp at the main desk but there was a definite lack of interest in what we told him was dangerous.
The room was not cheap, in fact the most expensive on our trip. We stayed at Caesars 5 years ago and this time it felt a lot more worn and tired. 
The breakfast was also out of our price range. For the 2 of us it was over $100 USD. We had breakfast next casino over.
However Caesars is a great place and I would recommend it. Lovely complex and my favourite position on the strip."
57,"눉
Charged me $13 for a cup of coffee in the room,, no free coffee provided"
58," otherwise,  no coffee available except room service. 
 The way I was treated when I was told to go stand in a line to check in when there were many people at the check-in desk that were not busy with anyone  just standing and looking out at the lobby.
The $53 I was charged for a hamburger, fries and root beer for room service.  (they add a $10service charge plus gratuity on top of overpriced food).   
Wait off 1 1/2 hours for dinner from  room service.
I played in the Casino and spent about $1200 without winning a single time.  A little frustrating.  Payback stats are terrrible.
. No room service menu or information about room or wifi information in the room.   
Not happy with overall value."
59,"눉
Octavious Tower and room were about as far away as could be. Not easy to pop back up to the room if you forgot something. Layout of the casino confusing. Could be hard to find things."
60,"눉
The lines to see Celine formed into the playing area. Cocktails were few and far between."
61,"눉
Everything feels like it’s more and more $... even coffee in the room is extra?  Internet extra?  Room service charges extra. We have $, but that’s the feeling I got."
62,"눉
We stayed here a few years ago. Was really looking forward to it But it wasn’t as nice !!!
Room was not as nice as before we could hear people in the next room !!!
All in all seems tired and not as nice as before"
63,"눉
There were many additional costs incurred that were not communicated effectively on check in. The room rate was already a decent sum, however it did not include wifi or gym access etc. 
beware of mini bar, it is operated by a computer system that immediately bills your room when you so much as move any item. You can't even use it for personal use unless willing to pay 25 USD"

If we had been able to see the Celine Dion show we came for, as it was cancelled due to her

Rooms were clean, spacious and very comfy beds. Liked the TV screen built into the bathroom mirror! Buffet was great! Lots of restaurants to choose from. Easy access to other hotels. The Forum shops were great place to shop and eat. Great pool and grounds...nice quiet area to relax. All the staff were friendly and helpful.  We would definitely stay here again!"
66,"눉
No breakfast despite info on Booking,com // not transparent resort fee // everything extra payable incl. water, parking, coffee..."
67,"눉
The nickel and dime the tourists. They charge $14 usd plus tax for 4 keurig pods with powered milk. Absurd. Stuff from the last guest was discarded by the last guest and housekeeping never cleaned it."
68,"눉
Forum is the oldest and most dated tower and is a 10 min walk from the lobby past all of the gaming machines, tables etc.  Room service is exceptionally prices ($175 for 3 standard breakfasts!)"
69,"눉
The place is chaos, finding the parking is hair-brained, check-in is insane.  Drinks and Food are extremely expensive ($22 for a draft Dos Equis).  Place is generally a mad house, but its fun to see...once."

Our room was very comfortable and clean, desk staff extremely helpful and accommodating. Friendly staff (Dante in the Apostrophy) made the experience that much more enjoyable."

OVERPAID WITH BOOKING.COM
BREAKFAST INCLUDED WAS A JOKE {there is nothing for breakfast at $10 a person}
a regular coffee and muffin at Starbucks at Caesars is over $10"
73,"눉
service not in the least geared for conference and business travellers, mail room closed at 6pm, unattended and dusted tea/coffee machine in room,  arrogant and unsympathetic night manager, do not recommended to use/stay here for business."
74,"눉
Everything is extra and you have to pay. Cesar Palace has a resort fee. Nobody explains to us what is this and what benefit can I get for pay this fee. You don't have choices they charge you anyway."

Everything was charged no tea or coffee etc we were booked into Celine Dion  but concert cancelled and we were not informed until we arrived at the hotel venue"
76,"눉
No mini fridge in the room. Everything else is good."
77,"눉
Mesa Grill's food was okay. The sales people at the facial stores were pushy and over charged their items."
78,"눉
Many things in the hotel room are sort of old, as you can see the safety lock is coming off the door. We got a room right above casino, so it was a little bit noisy. Staff are just okay."
79,"눉
They have a membresy system. If you are not platinum or 7 stars you are going to wait for long to be attended everywhere.
I paid 600 hundreds tte Night than is incredible expensive in compare the service i got.
When I arrived I wait more than one hour to be registerd. I has to discuss with the front desk boy who continuely repeat the preference in attetion was platinum members.
They pretty insists you do Web check in/out.
Last day they wanna to cash me extra water and food i ve never took. If you dont play attention you lost.
The air condition never was warm. They came twice to repair.
Cleaness really bad. 
Definitly i dont recomend this hotel."

Incredible hotel! The main lobby when you first arrive is spectacular,  and the staff friendly and helpful. The room was large with a super comfy bed.  We walked through exploring a few other hotels on the strip and Caesars Palace really stood out - exceptional!"
85,"눉
A little more attention by the staff to a really well designed bathroom would not go amiss. The magnifying mirror is a nice touch but it was grubby when I arrived and so was the Perspex tray in which they stage the lovely bath treats."
86,"눉
The price of the room and my window view"
87,"눉
I reserved a room with breakfast but unfortunately there is no breakfast in Caesar Palace"
88," they provide me of 20$ voucher on daily basis but all the restaurants, that I was authorized to use the voucher, prices are expensive and 20$ is not enough for one meal. Consequently, don't waste your time and don't buy breakfast during the reservation."
89,"눉
The prices for in room coffee, water and snacks was ridiculous compared to previous years.
For example, one bottle of water was $8.00. Since I drink about 6 bottles a day, the cost was prohibitive to stay hydrated."

Wow it’s was super nice, easy process check in check out, great support via text message, beds were very comfy, walking distance to anything you want to see! Really a great stay. Marvelous!"
91,"눉
Use of coffee pot in room too expensive. Didn't it. Misinformation on getting wheelchair assistance from bell desk. After half an hour wait for assistance from security walked with difficulty to and from shoe room for O'Reilly program. No place for my 85yr.old fragile brother to sit while I checked in. Was told that is what the lounge is for. There is plenty of room in that lobby for a few well appointed chairs that would not have interfered with the decor of the lobby
Cost for food is exorbitant."
92,"눉
I booked as included breakfast, there was no breakfast offered. Talk to official, showed my reservation, nothing got done. Very upset with this booking through booking .com"

It seems like parking should be free when you pay $275.00 for 1 room for 1 night. And food and drink prices were ridiculously high."

We got upgraded to an incredible top floor suite overlooking the Bellagio fountains and the Flamingo that made our stay unforgettable!!
Not bad for a first stay in Las Vegas!!
Service was great, the staff was friendly and helpful."
95,"눉
Charging $14 for a cup of coffee in the  room.  Coffee in the room should be complimentary!  Also WiFi charge is outrageous.  Felt like we were being nickel and dimed to death."
96,"눉
We got upgraded to a suite, for a lot of extra money, and didn’t like how simple the suite was. TV in the bedroom didn’t work and there was no radio at all. We stayed in the Mandalay Bay before and had a perfect suite for half the money. Ceasor’s Palace need to update their rooms."
97,"눉
The vanity lights above both sinks didn't work. The air only efficiently worked at 65, otherwise it wouldn't come on. I could clearly hear our neighbors arguing throughout the night."

Check in process.  The self checking machines tell you your room isn’t ready and they will email you when it was never got an email and so just went to the desk and they have is another room."
99,"눉
Charged for internet yet internet was free. Pool was open but not well equipped or staffed, yet resort fees remain the same all year round. Rooms were worn and tired. Old coffee pots left in machines, no laundry bags and terrible quality toiletries."
100,"눉
When we arrived we were given a room that was already occupied so it was a little frightening to think we walked into someone else’s room, and to think what if someone had walked in on us.  We then had to make our way back to the lobby which was not a short walk while being tired after traveling."
101,"눉
When visiting the concierge's desk to help with my email situation the lady was in the middle of helping me and just pushed us aside to help someone else.  It was extremely rude.  This happened twice during the time we were trying to get assistance."
102,"눉
Can’t think of anything we didn’t like."
103,"눉
I stated in my reservation that we were a family of 5 and therefore wanted two rooms next to each other.  We booked two rooms in Booking.com as they came offered for a group of 5 - we could not guess from the description of the rooms that they would be located on different towers.  Upon arrival, the staff at the hotel had no clue about the request - even though it was written very clearly. I had expected that someone from the Ceasars or from booking.com would have read it (I booked it over two months in advance, so there was plenty of time for someone to let me know before the trip that the two rooms booked could never be adjacent to each other).  Worse, they told me they couldn't help me fixing the problem because the reservation was through booking.com - ended up into an unpleasant argument with a manager before they finally changed rooms.  
This is one of the reasons why using intermediaries like booking , expedia, others becomes frustrating: when there are problems, hotels blame the intermediary and the intermediary blames the hotel."
104,"눉
The ""breakfast included"" is a lie. It only entitles you to 10 dollars off your meal per day. Maybe it was our innocence but when you see breakfast included it should mean breakfast is actually included. The price to eat in any of the restaurant's is quite dear also. The buffet was 59 dollars per person and even if you went to the fast food burger in the food court it would still set you back 19 dollars for a large burger meal.
We requested a non smoking room and to be fair thats what they gave us by putting us on a no smoking floor. But throughout the week we were there, people were constantly smoking in the hallways outside our rooms which kind of cancelled what we had booked. When I phoned reception about this, they did nothing about it."
105,"눉
The air in the room is good. The air in the hotel is horrible. We do not mind smokers. We also don't smoke but we felt like we did. Our clothes smell like cigarettes and our throats were sore. All the machine had full ashtray and ash all over them."
106,"눉
Room wasn't available at 4pm.  Went back repeatedly to kiosk and still wasn't available.  A staff member then helped us."
107,"눉
The major problem was that we had booked a suite. It turns out that ALL suites at Cesar’s Palace are SMOKING rooms. It smelled awful. I wish there was some way of knowing this up front before getting the room and then having to downgrade to a regular non-smoking room."
108,"눉
We were put in a handicapped room with a roll a way bed, even though I made my reservations weeks ago. The entire bathroom floor floods every time you showered, the bathroom sink didn’t drain and the roll a way bed was super uncomfortable. We were not happy."
109,"눉
Maid service getting charged twice and you won’t help room not ready"
110,"눉
except the smoke filled air that you could breathe free everything else was charged like crazy. a refrigerator packed of alcohol and you can't put your things in it. if you leave parking then coming back means charging again even for within the hour. even the coffee in room is charged after paying a crazy amount of stay rent/resort fee. its a no no for me forever."
111,"눉
Restaurant prices were outrageous.  Having to go through the smoky casino to get to the Colosseum."
112,"눉
No paid transportation to and from the airport.  Also, no late check out.  Most hotels I've been to have a shuttle, and most offer a late check out.  Also, no microwave, and no refrigerator space"
113,"눉
- Pool was closed for the season. No heated pool option available and we paid a daily resort fee anyway. 
- Breakfast was to be included however when we arrived at the hotel they said they would give us a $20 voucher to use at the restaurants in the hotel. The voucher didn't cover two people for breakfast.
- there was a $10 redemption if you declined house keeping per day and we decided to utilise that but the hotel wouldn't refund because they wanted to know that upon entry to the hotel not exiting.
- we were given our room keys by the hotel then told that's it. We had to ask about where breakfast was?? We also had to ask where our room was located in the many towers of the hotel. A brief explanation of the hotel was expected and this didn't happen."

Furniture was somewhat shabby.  NO COFFEE !! Apparently they do not provide complimentary coffee....of complimentary anything for that matter. For $340 a night ( oh yeah....they tax the crap out of you and charge a 'resort fee') I'd expect free coffee !!!"
115,"눉
Didn't like the feel of the place far to busy, no personal care, much prefer the Venetian hotel won't stay there again"
116,"눉
I so far haven't received the refund of my deposit. Tried to call the property, they transferred me several times to different department and finally I was transferred to the billing section, I was put on hold for half an hour then I decided to hang up, no time for that. I can't find any other way to contact this property, so I hope whoever reads this review can get in touch with me, I just need my deposits back how hard is that!"
117,"눉
The room was no different than any ""standard"" hotel room, except for the much higher price. The reality of the room definitely did not match the description and photos as advertised.  With well worn out threadbare sheets, no complimentary amenities (not even coffee), no view and noisy air conditioning...it was definitely very poor value for our money! 
With so many amazing hotels in Vegas, we will choose another one next time."

Couldn't find the pool.
My room smelled like weed.
The stuff was rude, treated my like i was broke."
119,"눉
Very big! Car retrieval from valet parking was slow."
120,"눉
Staff were not helpful and unhappy
We paid $500 plus for our room and had to pay for the coffee in the in room machine
The buffet at the hotel was very expensive and not good value or quality.  We won't stay here again"
121,"눉
The Wi-Fi is free for only two devices."
122,"눉
The resort fee just seems like something that should be in the past. It provides WiFi but only for two machines a day. The pool is only open from 9-5. There was a coffee machine but you were required to buy a coffee pack! I haven’t seen that before. The room was not cheap, so the coffee issue was disappointing."
123,"눉
Nothing, other than booking.com advertising that breakfast is included when it isn't, you only get $10 pppn which doesn't cover a lot."
124,"눉
The blinds in the suites are automatic by wall switches but it was stuck and didnt open or close. We notified the hotel and they told us they were going to send someone but that someone never came."
125,"눉
Just stay somewhere else honestly. We've tried multiple hotels on the strip and all of them pale in comparison to the Aria, which is a true 5 star. Caesar's palace not only looks tacky/cheesy (which is fine because it is a casino and themed) but everything else was also kind of low class. Being up-sold at the check in desk and feeling pressured to pay more for an upgrade was really uncomfortable, we'd already sprung for a fountain view room - so we weren't in a bad room anyway. We were there for one night and leaving at 6am for Yosemite, being held up at check in and given a hard sell pitch was a waste of time and unnecessary. I could go on, but this hotel isn't worth my time. Just go and stay at the Aria if you're looking for a 5 star experience."
126,"눉
Not clear how or where to get breakfast if it is included in your room's price. But there is Starbuck just downstairs so not the end of the world."
127,"눉
i always appreciate detailed, honest recommendations for booking shows. some type of information from caesar's regarding this topic would have been terrific. modern, honest, insightful reviews and thoughts, perhaps on a blog or leave behind. when you are from out of town, you need to know you can rely on a local expert opinion in order to make choices and spend your money the best way possible.
mini bar was exorbitantly pricey."
128,"눉
Breakfast wasn’t included as shown in Booking.com, rather you get $20 credit to use per day which doesn’t get very far at all - maybe good enough for one drink or one plate of eggs."
129,"눉
First room I got the bathroom was the worst I’ve ever seen in my life- so I had to pay for an upgrade and it was a total difference.
Pool hours at too limited only from 9am-5pm."
130,"눉
Lobby and public areas had a sweet perfume odor (no concern for allergy suffers).  The seafood odors emanating thru the hallways was a turn off."
131,"눉
Valet parking us too expensive $20/day, free at Venetian"
132, breakfast option to be avoided the credit given buys literally nothing
133," no-one checks who gains admission to floors with rooms unlike Venetian or Bally's, expected better security."
134,"눉
Was quite pricey for drinks around the pools. Also quite a long walk with your bags from the car park to the reception."
135,"눉
House keeping left products and dusting products in the room. They wanted to charge me for removing drinks out of the fridge as I was just borrowing the fridge. I put everything back in its position and they said that they were going to charge me to check I had put back properly."
136,"눉
The bed in our room in the new tower was very uncomfortable and is one primary reason why we may have to return to the Cosmo or Bellagio."
137,"눉
This hotel only look after the smokers, if you are not one, you will seriously suffer. There are no way of getting around to the rooms without going via the casino which is consistently covered with smoke. Due to the size of the hotel, there are no one to look after you, check in and out via kioks. They suggest you skip housekeeping for a mere $10 off a day. For the price we paid, is seriously not worth the money as the hotel has no ambience at all."
138,"눉
This accommodation was advertised with breakfast included however there was only a discount of $20 per room per day try and get breakfast for this amount"
139,"눉
Staff seemed disinterested in actually ensuring a pleasant stay for their guests. For example, upon arriving at the hotel, I purchased an upgraded suite for a better experience while in Las Vegas. One of the perks of the upgraded room was the convenience of a personal concierge willing and able to assist wherever necessary. The only problem was, the concierge kept calling and texting my wife (who was at home) asking if she needed anything. My wife kindly informed the concierge to please contact me (her husband) and provided my contact number, the room number etc. yet the concierge person kept texting my wife. Never once was I contacted during my entire stay thus I could not use the additional benefit of the personal concierge. The upgrade was a waste of money. When I brought this to the attention of the front desk staff, they did nothing to correct the issue."
140,"눉
Staff is extremely rude, wifi is expensive, there are many hidden fees and there are plenty of better hotels for young people."
141,"눉
The casino in Caesars seems to have more smokers (or poorer filtration systems) than the other casinos. No complimentary coffee in the room."
142,"눉
Air conditioning!! Too cold in a whole hotel!! We got cold. Do not be surprised with ""breakfast"" here because they don't serve breakfast like other hotels do. They have a lots of different restaurant inside the hotel so if you pay for breakfast that means that you can use 20$ a day for two person(10$ per person) and you can spend them in one of their restaurant(in the chosen ones) where you can't order a breakfast meal under 20-25$for one person without a drink. Lots of waiting until checking in and checking out. Paying for wi-fi even if you said that you don't need it, because you have your own mobile acces to internet."
143,"눉
Had a room with no view, was there for my wifes 50th.  We asked the front desk to move us to a different room and they did.  But with the hotel knowing we were there for her birthday and to give us such a bad room and then having to move all our stuff to another room was a little irritating but the new room was great and so was everything else."
144,"눉
AS ABOVE - OVERALL EXPERIENCE GOOD BUT EXPENSIVE - SPENT ONE NIGHT AT THE GOLDEN NUGGET IN DOWNTOWN VEGAS - ROOM GOOD BUT VERY NOISY - WE KNEW THERE WOULD BE A PROBLEM WHEN THEY GIVE YOU EARPLUGS!! BUT THE HOTEL ITSELF - FOOD GOOD - MUCH CHEAPER AND MY SON PREFERED THIS HOTEL TO CAESARS BECAUSE OF THE VIBE."
145,"눉
The AC was blasting!! Way too cold. Always had to bring a jacket while inside, which is annoying and inconvenient because it's really hot outside."
146,"눉
Would prefer costs of items to be inclusive of tax."
147,"눉
They could do better with the towels. They were really light and could barely hold water off the body. No robes and bathroom slippers in the rooms."
148,"눉
Tried to upgrade room for promotional value the staff denied the request since it was not booked ahead of time. Room had weird smell. Noted on reservation we were celebrating a birthday and they did not do anything for us at all. Ignored completely. Would not return especially when there are so many other hotels."
149,"눉
Wifi should be included. Bit expensive to eat or drink and cabanans over-priced as well. Resort fees are overkill"
150,"눉
Smoking downstairs was disgusting.  We walked in to the hotel and was hit with smoke and this continued day or night for our whole stay.  I thought smoking was banned indoors for USA so was shocked my heath and all the staffs health has been and being affected by smoking.
I will never visit Las Vegas again due to smoking indoors."
151,"눉
I didn't like the front desk..at all at Cesar Palace on wednesday night before our check out I was trying to talk about the night that we have to spend at the Bellagio unfortunately because of the horrible events sadly and su real .we have to say that Bellagio staff treat us great the 6 hrs 1/2 that we have to spend there because of the events @ las Vegas 10/01//17. Front girl call the manager and she stated that ""because we use a third party to book they can't do anything ""
I was very disappointed I felt descriminated because I used Booking.com to do my recervation. I used your web many times and I feel very comfortable with your service sadly I don't feel the same with ""Cesar Palace"" I usually visit Las Vegas once a year and I will never stay @ this hotel again."
152,"눉
Our stay was not long enough!"
153,"눉
The automated parking gate on the way out of the parking structure.  It is not user-friendly for those of us drivers who are short or have short reaches.  By the time I was checking out and inserted my room key into the collection box, it took me some time to get back into the car, and in that time the gate had already closed on us.  We had to contact an attendant by phone (pressed the button on the machine) to get assistance.  The attendant was very understanding, but the last thing I needed was this bit of aggravation and inconvenience!"
154,"눉
We didn't like the fact that there wasn't enough easily read signposts. We got lost quite often seeking the exits."
155,"눉
Their was one lady in parking valet who directed us to the back to check in...which didn't make sense to us. We went to back of hotel and they Re- directed us to the front. That was a bit of a mess because of all the cars and people. Our patience was tested a little."
156,"눉
Nothing. Although as expected things are pricey."
157,"눉
Communication with staff, check-in and check-out could be troublesome because of number of staff is not enough for number of guests."
158,"눉
the sewer smell in one of the bathrooms"
159,"눉
Normally, it's a casino hotel so that it will a bit noisy when you've got the room near the nightclub.  Moreover, the coffee bar inside the room was not free as a result be careful while you want to have something to eat or drink in your room."
160,"눉
The room service is really slow ( an hour to get water bottles) and the in room amenities was really poor no water bottles no coffee no bathrobes it was just empty"
161,"눉
Stuff is not friendly or welcoming. The lady at reception was grumpy and seemed to be tired. We didn't hear any sort of greeting from her at check-in, or anything like ""enjoy your stay"". 
No fruit plates/chocolate/flowers/compliments from the hotel are offered on birthdays or any special occasions.
Reception ladies at the buffet are haughty. 
At the same time all the waiters are super friendly and helpful."
162,"눉
The pool was not so clean as expected, and the roman decoration made me feel like in a fountain. 
The table service at Bacchanal Buffet is below average. I was not able to find our attendant to get any drink after our initial order."
163,"눉
We didn't like the weighted fridge. On arrival we took some things out of the mini bar to put water in, we were automatically charged for the things we removed due to the fridge being weighted. We got charges removed, so no big deal."
164,"눉
There was a sewage odor coming from on of the two bathrooms. We left the doors closed on bathroom to keep the smell down. Not pleasant. I should have complained at hotel. But never found the time to stand in line to wait."
165,"눉
The shower did not work and when i went to call the front desk to have it fixed, the phone was also not connected.  I then tried to connect it by following the phone line and it went behind the cabinetry so i could not fix it myself.  This meant we could not shower the night we arrived.  The next day we used the pool and showered in the pool bathroom."

Cold grey room dirty sofa with stains

as above"
169,"눉
Caesars Palace is a tourist attraction and by staying there you become part of the attraction. Anyone off the street can access the pool area when we were there.  A beefy security card shouts at you get out of the pool area at 6pm.  Anyone off the street can access any floor of the hotel. No information what so ever in the room about the resort.   And the icing on the cake is Booking.com advertising breakfast in the room rate and then only gives you $10 per person for breakfast!  No complementary tea or coffee in room.  $14 to make your own so much for the $10 breakfast voucher.  Breakfast in the restaurant is $50 plus tax plus tip"
170,"눉
Had to request for toothbrush and toothpaste which was fixed pronto.
Another thing, my partner said the AC was not cold enough although the temperature was at 
60 degrees."
171,"눉
No tea or coffee making facilities in the room, poor considering the price of rooms."
172,"눉
Hated that smoking was allowed in the hotel, although it was not nearly as bad as the other hotels/casinos."
173,"눉
Parking situation was deplorable.  We got in Sunday Night & tried to get Valet at the front of the Hotel.  Waited in line for 20-30 minutes only to be told it was not available.  Could not park there because it was full.  Then they gave us this small card with directions to the Colosseum parking.  Waited in line for another 20-30 minutes only to find out had no one at the Valet parking again so we had to Self park & drag all our bags and clothing through 300-yards of parking lot.  Then once we got into the Hotel another long line to get our room.  Then we were sent to the Nobu Hotel registration where they took care of us after a short wait."
174,"눉
It couldn't have been better."
175,"눉
It did not include breakfast as stated... Instead a $20 discount but that didn't cover breakfast costs."
176,"눉
Got repeatedly ID'd in the casino, at one point it was 4 times in 15 mins"
177,"눉
no real breakfast deal offered in the Caesar, only a $20 prepaid amount in total each day for the entire room to spare at one of the restaurants provided, which means for everyone in the room (in our case two). Access to the spa is allowed, which means you can access the spa as you are a customer of the hotel but you have to pay for it, which is non-sense as many other hotels offer the use of the spa for their customers. In the bathroom, the shower was ok but the bathtub with jacuzzi didn't work."
178,"눉
Food was expensive. There was no signal for 2 days so there was no television to watch."
179,"눉
Misleading and irrational!
Breakfast-
1. Deal says ""breakfast included"". In practice you get 20$ a day per room for use on some of the hotel's restaurants. This was not enough for 2 hot drinks and a snack.
2. They consider the 20$ to be used on the day before (e.g check in day is first breakfast day, even if you arrive by night), of course we discovered that by checkout.
Rooms-
We ordered a king bed room.
Upon arrival we were told that we got an upgrade.
Getting to the room we found a 2 queen room. Considered an upgrade because it costs more, but practically as a couple we can use only 1 bed, so this ""upgrade"" got us from a king bed to a queen bed.
Eventually we got our original room order after 1 night, and a breakfast for the last day.
However, we had to argue with them about it."
180,"눉
False advertising and hidden costs accompanied by very pool customer service.
1. On arrival, the self service check in didn't work, the que was long and slow, understaffed and when finally being served, no manners, poor customer service and no information about our stay. we have to find out everything for ourselves, not what expect for the price. 
2. It said that breakfast was included and there was a coffee machine in the room. Breakfast WAS NOT included, a $10 credit on site was, again, we had to find this out for ourselves. When we went to claim this back, we found out that one of the places we had breakfast wasn't owned by Ceasers and we missed out on our $40 discount. There as a coffee machine by the way... but no coffee... you could use the minibar to get 4 coffee pods for $12 thought... we opted to go buy our own"
181,"눉
Absolutely no worth the money . Smells cigarette smoke everywhere , rude stuff at check in not explaining anything . Charged €35 resort fees doesn't let you use any fascilitoes apart from outdoor pool that as well surprise surprise closing at 6pm and some days at 4pm . No bottle of water in the room for guests dedpite price . Total rip off, but it's Las Vegas - the end of the world !"

The room was beautiful and the staff was incredible but the room had issues, a light in the bathroom didn't work, the electrical sockets in the bathroom didn't work the Jacuzzi didn't work and the air condition went out one night, the fixed everything right away but for what the room cost it should not have had those many issues."
184,"눉
Wi-fi connection awful!!! Even with extreme resort fee paid, very bad internet connection or no connection at all. ""Breakfast included"" is a joke. Only $10 per person, max of $20 per room allowed daily for room service food or drinks. On average $25 to $30 is breakfast for one person, so $10 per person doesn't do anything. Only two devices allowed on wi-fi otherwise additional charge!  Checking in front desk staff not so friendly. I broke a glass in the bathroom, it took over 2 hours for someone to come and clean the bathroom floor since the glass was all over. When we came back to the room, figured that the floor wasn't truly cleaned, just large peaces of glass picked up. There was still a lot of small glass peaces over the floor, so we had to put shoes on when walking in."
185,"눉
Check-in took 45 minutes. The receptionist who dealt with us tried to get us to upgrade to a newer, larger room. He tried a little too hard and made us feel a little uncomfortable. We didn't spend the extra money and were very happy with the room we had.
The snacks and bottled water are on a tray with sensors. I believe that if you lift the items from the tray, you are charged whether or not you consume them. This is explained in one of the books in the room but it isn't obvious. I understand there is also a charge for the fridge if you use it for your own goods."
186,"눉
You do not really interact with the staff. Everything is automatic: check in, chek out.....
I do not like that they try to make money on everything: water, faster wifi, snacks and event early check in!!"
187,"눉
There was no breakfast even though it was supposed to be included in the room rate - I got only a $10 voucher which was not enough for a meal at their overpriced restaurants
Automated check-in kiosk - my room was not available and was only ready after I reported it to one of the staff members
Impersonal touch - had to wait in lines to talk to any of the staff, no one to tell you about the facilities and surroundings - the opposite of a luxury hotel!
Very difficult to find reception from parking - had to walk 20 min around the crowded casino
The hotel and room decor felt dated."
188,"눉
Paying parking even if you stay at the hotel. Gambling tables were a little bit full at night even though it was Tuesday."
189,"눉
No complaints about the hotel. However, one word of warning, Booking.com stated that the room price included free breakfast, this is not the case - you do get a $20 allowance for food per day but this would not cover breakfast.....this is an error on Booking.com's part and not the fault of the hotel."
190,"눉
Booked with included breakfast, however they just give you a $20 voucher per day for food. The breakfast there is $40 plus so the voucher doesn't cover it. 
Everything is very pricey."
191,"눉
We arrived at the self parking but there was no signage (where we parked anyway) to indicate the way into the hotel. After some confusion and asking directions we eventually arrived at reception. The room (non smoking) did smell of stale smoke. Also, there are probably thousands of rooms in the hotel and we were unlucky to get a room with a view of the side of the hotel wall (room 6019 if anyone gets allocated this room). We only stayed two nights but for a longer stay, a room changed would've been requested. Word of caution, don't go near the minibar, you will be billed for even touching the contents!"
192,"눉
Washroom could have been cleaner. Room is musty . It smells smoky even though i requested a non-smoking room... hard to find which tower your room is booked..no clear signs...very confusing and path to the tower smells very smoky from cigarette smoke. Dress code should be enforced in the casual dining rooms specially men.. hate seeing men eat with their armpits hair sticking out...just ruins my appetite.... the hotel should look into this and all the dining rooms should enforce at least a dress code that covers the armpit, specially when the armpit is so hairy...yuks.. Elevators also smells cigarette smoke which literally makes you choke......this should be enforced as well...."
193,"눇
Enjoyed the pool area very much, The drinks were expensive, but you did get a larger drink. We did find it hard to find out where we were going. We had to ask people all of the time where things were. Because it was a holiday week end it was hard to find a place to eat. I called on the phone and no one at the desk could help me get a reservation for a place to eat.  But we understood that. All of your staff were very friendly and nice to us."

Paying $13.00 for K-cups!?  Not cool.
While shopping, we noticed there was no pricing on many items.  Not surprised when purchase totals were very high.  I know.  It's Caesar's.  It's Las Vegas.  But I still hate sticker shock."
202,"눉
No complimentary tea/coffee in rooms which feels stingy, no soap or shampoo in showers by pool which was annoying if you've  checked out already. loud air con but room a little stuffy without. Unhelpful bell desk and taxi rank - conflicting advice on transport to the airport."
203,"눉
The fact the we asked for a shower chair for
My aputee friend and never got it after 5 hours very disappointed and he couldn't shower."
204,"눉
The room was extremely disappointing. Very poorly kept and very wore down, furniture was scratch, furniture looked dirty and old. Upon arriving we reported that the blinds and curtains, which are electronic, were not working. They said someone would be up within 20-30 minutes, nothing. Called later that same night around 8, told them no one came up and same thing. Called again at around 12 to tell them that the problem was reported twice and never fixed. Went to bed. At around 6 am, room across us starts getting loud. Some dude kept knocking very hard on the room door across us, he then banged the door and screamed, kicking followed, which woke us up. Again I call to tell them, they tell me they are sending security right away, well this went on another 30 minutes, awake all this time cause the guy does not stop and security never makes it there, called again, get told the same thing. The door banging and kicking and shouting keeps on going till about 7 am and I dont think security ever made it. So did not slept well at all. 
 Visit was rather disappointing, I thought that Ceasars Palace would be beautiful and well kept and it was not. I will not stay there again and will not recommend it to any one. I have videos of the screaming guy that I would love to share."
205,"눉
On the second last day we awoke to smell of weed coming through the A/C.  Housekeeping was sent to deodorize the room, but was not really that effective.  The only place you could use breakfast credit was Payard's Patisserie, where there were not a whole lot of options anyway. Also $10 per person does not get you very far in Caesar's Palace."
206,"눉
I used the internet for 5 minutes and they hit me with a $35 ""resort fee"". Regular drink at the bar was $24.00! What a scam!"
207,"눉
Check-in was very difficult.   There was a self service check in which I could see some people were having trouble with and the queue for the actual desk to see a real person was massive.
It was exactly the same to check out.   There is a real need for more people here.
We had issues extending our stay and the keys didn't work so I had to wait in that queue to get the keys switched.... painful.
The pools also need to have an adults only area. If there was one I didn't see it or it wasn't enforced."
208,"눉
The self-parking lot is a little bit too far from the check-in lobby."
209,"눉
It's a caos to walk in the casino itself. The lobby was very far away from the room. Pool was not that good (I mean, it's a good pool, but I prefer the one in the Bellagio)"
210,"눉
It takes forever to check-in, parking the car was very complicated (no instructions as to how to enter). There was also no assistance as to how to reach reception, and no assistance as to how to get to our room (it's a huge hotel). The rooms are pretty dated (ours had a... CD player!)."
211,"눉
It is too big and too crowded. the check-in took more than an hour.
finding the right tower was not easy.
we were in the newly renovated tower,however, the renovation did not seem to include the elevators as they were producing an annoying sound."

The price drinks at the poolside, and the fact you had to pay for coffee in the room was crazy!!"

I didn't get a strip view and hotel is very huge so it takes a few minutes to get to your room"

It was difficult to park even with valet parking on Saturday night, front entrance was full so they sent us to another parking lot at the back without clear direction. And the casino is always full of smokers so not great place to stay if you can not stand the smoke. Food inside the hotel is overpriced and not very tasty."

There are hidden daily resort fees ($39/day ) and high frequency of cleaning room service charge (up to three time/day x $8).  The cleaning work was NOT request by us and it was done while we were NOT in the room.

-Smoky room
-I've booked three identical rooms but Booking has failed to arrange the rooms to be located on the same floor.
-There are HIDDEN daily resort fee ($39 USD per day per room) and too many DAILY room service charges (i.e. two to three times per room for un-necessary cleaning service charge - $8 x 3 times x 3 room)????  I am so disappointed."

I think wine/ champagne glasses and tea cups need to be in the room so that you don't need to ask the room service all the time. A Nespresso machine is a must for a hotel of that level. We get used to good coffee in European hotels."

Personal not nice, cold hotel (stop the air conditioning, I had to wear jacket), in the swimming pool could enter EVERYBODY (even NOT guests, amazing!), NOT free parking, not free wifi, 1hour waiting for the check in and check out (AMAZING, even at the machines, please more personal in the front desk!), the parking is 15 min walking to the front desk (with all luggage) through all Casino"

The bed is very comfortable and the shower is superb otherwise I felt the room very small and the view unacceptable . It is overall very dirty and we ate at the steakhouse where the service is average and the dishes outrageous expensive. Honestly I had higher expectations ."

Staff was unprofessional. I was told by Shamay (if that was her real name?) that there was no strip view rooms and u get whatever rooms are available even though I paid more for strip view. She said I booked through 3rd party and booking.com need to redo website because not correct saying strip view."

Having booked on Booking.com for another individual was problematic AT THIS HOTEL.  Entire hotel cost was not charged on credit card online.  Rather, the difference had to be paid by the guest upon arrival, defeating the purpose of my purchasing the room for them.  It was lucky they had enough money to cover the remainder which the hotel refused to charge to the same credit card used online.  The hotel staff did not explain this well upon arrival and we thought we were getting double-charged.  It took phone calls to both Bookin.com and Ceasars customer support to find out what was going on as well as multiple tries at the Hotel check-in.  The issue was not fully resolved (as described above.)"
223,"눉
We didn't like the fact that we were told that breakfast was included in the room rate. This is in fact a LIE and we actually got a $10 voucher each per day which gets you NOWHERE as one continental breakfast shared between 2 was $42 and the cheapest breakfast is $22 dollars excluding a drink. Had we know that breakfast was actually not included in the room rate, we would not have stayed there. We tried to complain to the hotel staff but they were rude and unsympathetic."
224,"눉
Overcrowded
Too many people at the pool, couldn't find a bed to sit at
Room service food was disgusting, took over an hour to get to the room, didn't even eat it. When I went to complain I was told would get a call back when the manager was available. I was not in the room and when I called again same story
Room was small and view was terrible
Taxi line always too long
Lines to check in are also enourmous"

The internet connection wasn't great and the additional fees for more than two devices was annoying when there were 4 people in the room. Robes in the rooms would have been good and slightly better lighting as the room did feel quite dark."

The rooms smelled terrible. We had non-smoking rooms, but they smelled like smoke. We asked for them to be neutralized, but no one ever came."

It was a dive! Filthy and disgusting pool area. Pools not cleaned cloudy water and scum floating on the top. Staff disinterested and not bothered. Human poo in lifts and corridors for 24 hours. Book with breakfast but in reality you get $10 credit per person per day and the breakfast buffet costs $50 per person! A Diet Coke will set you back $10 plus tax. Everyone expects a tip! There are several pools and would be lovely if they cleaned it. It's filthy. Loads of shops in the forum shopping centre but again I think the prices have been hiked up. There was a Rolex that in the uk is £18,000 but there it is nearly $29,000 even with the current exchange rate it still comes out over £24k. The weather was great and if I ever went back it would be to a different hotel as this one really is the pits! Which is a shame. Oh yeah you don't even get free tea or coffee making facilities in your room. It's $13 for a kit that will give you 4 coffee pods and coffee mate powder. There is tax on top of that too and there is a $39.99 resort fee per day per person too! Won't return to this poor hotel"
228,"눉
As we all know, its got a great brand name but for me and my family, it was nothing more then a 'cattle market' not a hotel - long queues, thousands of people everywhere - paid parking that went up in $ without any prior notification - rooms didnt have any tea/coffee facilites, no breakfast, so long queues on a morning just for a coffee.
There was also a major confrenace on while we were there and they just took over the whole hotel - if you take children - make sure you never let go of there hand!
I know we are all differnt and want differnt things but this was the biggest disapointment of our whole trip."
229,"눉
the hallway is dirty! There was dishes left  all day. Hallway smell smoking and weed! I have allergy! Don't want to experienced that first time we were arrived. There was a black stain on the sheet. Not really clean for the price we paid.  Other hotels is better with clean sheet. The small brown blanket were stain too with iron burn. Don't see any quality at all. Won't come back at all. Not worth it!!"

Check in was a hassle.  Finding the elevator to our room was difficult as the place is so huge that we walked for 45 minutes trying to find the correct elevator.  Would be nice to have elevators next to the check in site.  Also the parking did not have signage to guide the guests to the hotel.  We parked on the opposite end of where we needed to be and had to walk the parking garage to get to the actual hotel elevator to lobby."

It is a very busy hotel, so you have to be ok with a high level of energy."

No opening windows, only A/C. Shower was working, however the holder of the shower did not work (welcome to vegas suites).
No possiblity to use cash on the reception, at least during the checkout. 
Noone reminded about missed checkout (i know that this is my fault, but still, it would be better if the called me or at least dropped an email).
Houseclean woman knocked in the morning, i asked to come later. Moreover, i put a ""please clean my room"", however, the room still was not cleaned."

When we booked our room, it included breakfast. But, a $20 credit DOES NOT cover breakfast for 2 at any hotel in Las Vegas, including Caesars Palace. Coffee or tea is $5.00..all entrees are $20 and up. Also, you only get the $20 credit if you charge the meal back to your room. We felt that the 'Breakfast included' was misleading.
There is a coffee maker in the room, but you have to pay for the coffee pods to make a cup.
Bathrobes are no longer available!"

Got an upgrade. One bedroom suite with a view of a wall. Would have rather received a King room with a view. Blood on bathroom floor. Room phone didn't work. Air conditioner was spotty.

No sun umbrellas in the pool area. Wifi and network is terrible even though you're paying for it through the daily resort fee and only allows for 2 devices! Other hotels offer free wifi! For such a big, luxurious property they need to improve their network. The charge of $15/day for wifi for each additional device is absurd and a cash grab."

Check-in was a disaster (took 1.5 hours), earliest check-in was 4:00 pm, and the room was not still ready by 4:45 pm, rooms are quite a distance from front desk, as well as the car park"
253,"눉
The rooms are quite far from the reception (it takes between 10 and 15 minutes to get to the reception desk from the room) and there is always (regardless of time) a line at the counter. This makes it difficult to solve any problems you may have.
I had booked a non-smoking room in the premium category.  I got an amazing room with crazy-beautiful views, but that was connected through a door to another room where the guests smoked. My clothes and luggage smelled for days.
When we asked for a solution, we were moved to a room of a lesser category. Although a really nice room, I had paid for another room category. This was not explained to me at the desk, neither was I asked if I wanted to change categories.
We had further problems with the self-parking validation (valet parking is around 20 dollars and if you plan to move around Vegas in your car during your stay, this is not a very sustainable option) and had to spend a lot of time coming and going to and from the reception and waiting in line to get our problems solved.
All in all, the staff who helped us with our problems were very nice and helpful, but unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the hotel cares what kind of experience the guests have or about making problems right. 
For a hotel that claims to be of such category and demands such prices, I would have expected a better guest service."

The price of the buffet. We went just before 10 PM (after a show we attended) and we were going to be charged $70+ per person for maybe 30 minutes to eat if we were lucky. The gentleman at the register wasn't very friendly so we declined and ate elsewhere."

The lights in the room was dark.
Long way to walk from the self parking through all the casino to the check in and back again to the room with the bags after 5 hours of driving... I understand that everything made to make me go straight to the casino... but i didnt like this."
268,"눉
I tried to play straight Black Jack at a $10 table and work my bets up to as high as $100. I was not able to find a seat last night and today around noon. 
I was also not happy with the number of times I was approached by prostitutes all over the casino. 
I had my family who lives in Arizona meet us for breakfast at the American Grill. There was nothing about the American Grill that's American. There was a total of six of us and the check came to $249 including tip. The food quality for what we paid was terrible. The eggs Benedict where way over cooked, the bacon was so over cooked it was black in color, the ham steak I ordered was burnt the only thing good about the breakfast. I had to apologize to my guests for such a terrible experience."

No complimentary coffee. $13 for in room 4 cup coffee. Everything thing was extra. Nothing except sleeping and bath, and television included in room price. $40 per day resort fee. We do not even gamble."
270,"눉
Disappointed that such a highly sort after hotel had so many extra room costs involved. A $25 charge to unlock the mini fridge was excessive and $15 for wifi seemed like just another way to make money. For such a large hotel I felt like everything was very overpriced and perks such as the above should be complimentary which would really help to add to the seemingly ""luxuriosness"" of the hotel. 
It was also very easy to get lost in such a large hotel. We found the wayfinding very lacking which made it very hard to find anything in the hotel. When visiting other hotels we didn't experience the same confusion when finding our way around. So more signage would be hugely beneficial! 
Although we were upgraded to an amazing room we were never told about the renovation works that were happening in the wing we were upgraded too. Had we been told about this in advance we would have asked not to be upgraded as construction was happening in the room right above us, waking us up each morning at 7am. Ideally people would be advised about this before being upgraded."

Expect long waits for just about everything! Requested early check in and paid for it,eight hours later,still no room, finally was assigned a room only to find out it was already occupied!! After finally getting a room and heavy complaining,spent most of the evening at the Paris casino,which was very enjoyable, returned to my room to settle in and watch some TV,only to discover it didn't work,so had to call the desk and wait for service. It seemed like everything that could go wrong did,it's a beautiful place but seemed more hype than service and comfort and definitely not worth the price especially after all the hassle it took,one night was all I could handle,spent the rest of my vacation at the Bellagio."
274,"눉
The level of service of the staff was not up to an hotel of this category. For example, at the front desk, we have waited a very long time for check-in and check-out. Only 1-2 receptionist, even if there was a long line-up. We know we can check-in/check-out online, but had questions to ask to the receptionist. Another example: the hostess at the dining room was rude! In one word, the feeling we had is that we were bothering them! It is a large hotel and we can feel it!"
275,"눉
I don't understand the resort fee, in other locations things like WiFi are free. $35 / day seems excessive. I understand this is a Las Vegas 'thing' not just Caesars."

I was very disappointed having to pay for parking! You would think that after paying for a high priced suite it would be free, also we had a coffee maker in the room but no coffee for it!"

Very expensive place to stay between the hotel fee, resort fee, meals, drinks etc...  It can really add up quickly.  
Hotel charged $40/night for a ""resort fee"" on top of the nightly hotel fee.  I would have thought the hotel fee would cover the ""resort fee"".  I think it's just another way to get more money from us.  Resort fee didn't allow access to sauna, hot tub or steam room which was depressing."

Check in lines are quite long"
303,"눉
Extremely disappointed with hidden mandatory charges of $30/day for the spa (which actually you had to pay a further 35$/day to even get access to). This is not something I would have minded paying for if the hotel were upfront about the costs - but rather it was something that was brought to my attention at check-in. 
The facilities e.g. pool etc. were used by everyone from other hotels so I fail to see why people wouldn't stay at cheaper hotel-casinos and just go to Caeser's during the day. 
Staff seemed confused about charges that were mandatory etc. Wifi was very patchy."

There is some type of water transfer point in the locked cupboard in room 1040 in the Palace tower that generally stayed on all night. It was hard to get a decent sleep. Also there appeared to be workers completing Maintenance work above or below us during the day which was excessively loud so it meant the one day I could get an afternoon sleep in was impossible as I only had one full day to stay here. Other than that it was great."
309,"눉
Check in and check out staff was a big disappointment. Unfriendly and the least bit helpfull each time we spoke to them. Such a great Hotel which can do with some better customer service. A disappointing end to our stay as the check in and checking out was horrible."

I did bot like being woken at 6 am each day by drilling and hammering. The hotel did not inform us on arrival that this work was ongoing. Booking.com have done nothing at all to help with this in fact they lied in saying that they had contacted the hotel. I made the booking with you so you have a responsibility to deal with this, Guest services at the hotel were patronising to say the least, This was meant as a treat but instead I may as well have stayed at home as I am up earlier with sleep disturbed by the construction site. Also be aware of the £200 deposit that we were not told about, also all three of the pools are dirty with no filtration running and leaves with floating around. Also we clearly come second in terms of service to convention customers."

Check-in (Maria). Took 1h, they couldn't find my reservation even after I provided booking reference number. Didn't say sorry for inconvenience."

Everything was either over priced or a trick to get you to pay more money. We paid for a pool view and only could see the pool if we stood on our tip toes and even then was a few cms of the pool. Majority of the staff were not helpful and were more in a rush then anything. The hotel had a very pretentious quantity over quality feel and by the end of it we just wanted to get out of there"

Renovation work meant we were woken up at 6.30am and asked to be moved to a different part of the hotel.
Air in casino gets way too smokey in the evening."

Having a mini suite in the palace tower I was most disappointed robes weren't provided. 
And even the most basic hotel almost always provides complimentary tea/coffee making facilities in the room so this was a big let down. We paid the $13 charge for the inroom coffee (4 cups) however my husband having a sweet tooth used all the sugar in the package for one cup. We requested extra sugar from housekeeping (while leaving a generous tip)  but this never came. In the end we took extra portions from the bellagio buffet - which was also better value."
324,"눇
I recommend Ceasar Palace for every person going to Vegas that want to enjoy vegas and a wonderful pool. There are other options on lower costs but the Caesar Palace is not only a place to stay is also to enjoy it. Highly recommended mainly because of the wonderful pool."

The registration area too smoky. Smoke from casino. Line up to check in was too ooooo long. Just three agents at peak time"

We'd been offered a free 'upgrade' to a room in the Palace Tower when checking in. However, there was hammering and construction noise above the room from 7.15am, which we'd not been warned about when checking in. We phoned the house keeper and she said nothing could be done about it. The 'resort fee' was waived but this was a small recompense for the fact we couldn't sleep in due to the noise. Also, there was a 25-minute wait before checking in. Parking was VERY confusing: self-parking wasn't clearly sign-posted (we saw no signs anywhere for it), so we had to use the more expensive valet parking. Also, it's ridiculous that you have to pay for parking on top of the room price when the hotel/casino wouldn't get any visitors without parking! You can't even make a coffee in the room without paying. The restaurants on site are over priced (we went to Rao's, where we found the staff unfriendly and the food wasn't worth the $70 per head price tag.) This place is out to fleece guests for whatever it can."
328,"눉
During a reservation breakfast was include but  I didn't like that during a check in I found that breakfast isn't include in the room rate. On reception I got a answer that: order was made thru the booking.com so if you have any problem please speak with them. We are not provide breakfast it not include."
329,"눉
I am a seasoned traveler and have never experienced the nickle and dime fees I had at Caesars.  The fees for everything were ridiculous and for this reason I would hesitate to stay there again.  $13.00 pp if you want a coffee kit to use in the room Keurig is crazy. I didn't have a simple room I had a mini suite. 
$30 check in fee if you get there early. We are talking 2 hrs early, amazing how a room was available if you paid the fee."

1) Didn't like the Smoke in casino. But it was the same at every casino. 
2) We were told at the desk that we could check out late up until 2pm for a fee of $30. However when we called to put this in place we were told no. They did give us a courtesy late check out of noon. So that was helpful."
331,"눉
Smoking in the public areas and while we had a coffee machine in the room, it cost 13 dollars for a coffee tab."
332,"눉
This property is so large that it takes a very long time to get anywhere from your room. Also the layout of the main casino floor is very confusing."
333,"눉
I wish I had more access to coffee, as silly as that sounds. The coffee in the room was outrageously expensive. But I suppose that's what happens in Vegas!"
334,"눉
Don't go to 'Americano' which is the restaurant in the lobby.  It is way overpriced and food isn't good... with so may options in Vegas I'm surprised they keep such a poor restaurant in the lobby."
335,"눉
The first room they gave us was dirty, the sink in the bathroom was cloaked and the bathroom was floated after one shower. Some of the staff were rude and especially one of the managers."
336,"눉
Hotel is too big with poor directional signage. Pillows were horrible. Plastic cover made a crinkly noise when you move. Horrible! Loyalty desk handled traffic flow poorly."
337,"눉
Difficult access to room through the casino with luggage."
338,"눉
hotel debit your card without telling you, even when we specifically asked when checked in to not do that cause we watned to pay cash at the end
they take a card détails when checkin for ""autorisation"" but they will debit that card without telling you anything
first and last time in Caesar"

Got stung for $26 resort fee on check out increasing the the price to $190 a night - resort fees should be included in the room fee.
Difficult to find the way to the room.
My friends room has dirty water and he had to listen to loud drilling from 8am."

The entire staff from valet to security were amazingly helpful. They all greeted us with a sincere attitude everyday. The hotel has a great variety and quality of foods to choose from. And the beds were extraordinarily comfortable."
341,"눉
Furniture in room beat up.  Odd seating pieces in room that didn't match.  The tv in bathroom didn't work .  Two cleaning carts were left in our hallway both nights."
342,"눉
We came for a concert and not for gambling. We were placed at the Nuvo hotel (which is located inside Caesars Palace) and which we were told is an upgrade. Newer design but some out claustrophobic, and smell of cigarettes in room and all over the Caesars Palace. Next time we will choose a hotel where there is more differentiation between the casino area and the other ""free"" area. It was too hectic and smelly for us."
343,"눉
None. Our whole experience staying at Caesars Palace is faultless! 😃
Would happily stay here again in the near future."

The forum rooms are terrible , smoking and stale smell , the furniture was very bad and marked and in need of repair . The octavos rooms are excellent"

260 dollars for small room with no coffee set, view of the roof of adjacent building, no complementary Internet, hot water after 10 minutes, 25 dollars charge for using minibar fridge in my room to cool my own coke?! And it was upgrade to Nobu..."

You have to pay for wifi and late check-in time. They set as normal check out in the morning and you have to pay for extended check-out..every small steps are charged additionaly..."

Charging us15 per day for wifi and charging USD 13 to use the coffee machine in the room!  I complained at reception, got a 'manager' complained to him. Got nowhere. He wanted to talk about the fact that they don't yet charge for parking whereas MGM do!!!!!!"
349,"눉
Breakfast was hugely overpriced even with a $20 daily allowance included with our room. We paid around $90 for 2 people on the one and only time we dined in the hotel. Lots of places close by on the strip which are more reasonable"

The bathroom floor was not very clean.  Housekeeping did a poor job when our room was cleaned. Overall, the room made me not want to walk on the floor without shoes.  I would have expected better with"

Bell service man was visibly irritated with having to take everyone's bags. Didn't appreciate his attitude since he was the first person I talked to walking into the hotel. But all other staff were friendly and accommodating"
352,"눉
Cabinet door hinge was broken and never got fixed. Seems like something that would be addressed immediately for a resort of this caliber. Made it feel like a motel that didn't really care about what it looked like."
353,"눉
Renovations near our room were not disclosed in advance.  Work began as early as 6:30 a.m. And continued until about 6:00 p.m.  We couldn't rest in our room during the day because it was so noisy.  Disappointing."
354,"눉
I booked hotel with breakfast and hotel is not providing any. Breakfast in bufet cost 50+$.
I will ask for re-funding it.
I did not get room I booked, and reception tried to give me single bed with side bed instead of two bed room. Reception was very unprofesional."
355,"눉
Room requires maintenance, couches needed replacement and very dusty. Also, didn't like the heavy smoke smell having to walk a distance to where our lift was to enter the rooms. Didnt appreciate bookings.com inaccuracy on additional room rate charges and breakfast inclusions when this is not the case."
356,"눉
Extortionate mini bar prices ($7 for a bottle of water!) & no free coffee in the room."
357,"눉
The waiting staff were rude in the casino, refusing to provide us with a drink whilst gambling. The service at the bars was unacceptable, the few staff doing nothing ignored you & when they finally did serve you were unfriendly & some were rude."
358,"눉
The towers we stayed in are dated. For the rate we paid, we were a little disappointed with the room."
359,"눉
Our room was broken into, casinoe chips stolen and our hotel room door was malfunctioning. 
Also, I advised on check in we were arriving a day late. We were still charged for the night we missed, despite the check in person saying we would not."
360,"눉
We encounter rude staff members and were mistreated after spending a large sum of money inside the club Omnia. The room was also not as clean as expected. Hairs in the bathroom floor and shower."

Expensive at $253 per night doubleroom! And impersonalof course."

The check in process was an absolute nightmare. Firstly, with booking.com we bought 'breakfast included' however when we checked in we were told breakfast is not included. Instead we were given $10 voucher for each morning to spend at very limited outlets owned by Caesars palace. However none of these food outlets had breakfast items for $10 or less. So there was no way to buy breakfast with $10. The actual Ceasaes palace buffet costs $40 per person. We were not offered an apology or any solutions to this problem. In fact, the rude staff member told us ""you should sue bookings.com for false advertising"". Utterly disappointing. 
Secondly, when checked into our room and the disappointment continued. We were on the lowest floor in the oldest tower. Our window faced a brick wall. The room was old and small. Nothing like our expectations. We called reception to ask for a room change and we're told we would have to vacate the room and it could take up to 12 hours for another room to be ready. As it was 5pm this was not an option. Finally after speaking to the manager we were transferred to a slightly better room. 
Thirdly, as we paid the overpriced 'resort fee' we were offered wifi included. At check out we were charged 4X$14 charges for apparently a third device connected. We did not have any other devices except one phone each so this was impossible. After lining up at reception for 20 minutes this was finally replaced back on our card, of course with no apology. 
Overall your Caesars palace and booking.com experience was not only disappointing but heart breaking. I will never be recommending this hotel or website to anyone in the future."

Bed was very comfortable   Room was quiet even though we were by elevator.  Stayed in octavious tower.  Rooms nice but needed a little updating.  Very convenient to all areas of the hotel.  Would definitely stay again.   Food and restaurants pricey but good especially Gordon Ramsey's."

Price of food and drinks in property restaurants was high, but it's the same at the other casinos on the strip."

everything. The staff was very rude. They said they'll take 200$ deposit but they took 354$ deposit and not telling me the exact reason why ( saying they don't know why it took that much.. really?) & Now i look at my account and they took 190$ from my account for what reason?  i don't know :)"

Rooms need to be updated.  Very old in The Palace. Will not stay in that hotel again.  I like modern updated hotels."

Smoking in Casino"

I don't know if it's a Vegas thing, but housekeeping seem to just let themselves into your room any time they like. I'm talking 7am on the day you check out. They don't knock. Just walk straight in. And they did it constantly!
Also, if you're considering going to Omnia because of the incredible reviews, make sure you go on a night where the main room is open. Luckily, we asked the concierge how to get on the door list. If we hadn't, we would have forked out over $50 to go to the smaller, bland, nothing overpriced nightclub attached to Omnia.
Also also, the people working the retail stores in the hotel (not in the Forum shops) really have their hustle on. Beware. They have a quota to reach."

the casino had a terrible odor in the south side, near restaurants and parking garage. I had to walk by this daily. I almost threw up in my mouth the smell was so bad.  I would not have stayed at this hotel had I known they had this disgusting smell.."

Old old old. Needs some updating desperately! They upgraded us to a superior room. Goodness I don't know what our other room what have been like. Our sink handle was loose and had issues shutting off. The shower door was cracked. The light was burned out - which they replaced for us. No microwave. The fridge in room was useless- they stocked it with over priced alcohol and soda. It automatically charges you if it's moved so you can't even remove it to put your own water or left overs in it. The pool was closed. The check-in /out lines were incredibly slow. They staffed one person behind the desk and one person to stand by the line to tell you it was your turn. Just put them both behind the darn desk to move things along!!! We were charged 3x for the room so rather than dropping the key cards and going home we had to stand in that long slow line again just to be told they will not process all 3 charges. They just do that ""in case"" she said. Totally confusing and a waste of time."

Congested hotel.
U have to wait in lines for check in check out.
Because the hotel is so big and there are no directions to the lobby counters, it was a bit confusing check in"

Was disappointed with that you could not use the spa facilities as a guest/ had to pay extra. (Not the treatments I mean the Roman baths etc, I think as a paying guest you should not have to pay more for that)."
373,"눉
It was really a bad experience for the standing of this hotel. First of all we had our room 1h30 later. Secondly, it was not the good room. We had to change all our luggages by ourself and to go at the opposite of the hotel. I think for this kind of hotel people should do that for us. Finally, we spent the worst night ever because we had been wake up at 7am because of works in the hotel ! It's totally unexapetable ! The hotel is big and it's not a high season so I think they should close the part of the hotel with the works. We told the hotel for the terrible noise and they really didn't care. So I definitely not recommend this hotel !"

That you had to pass by the casino and get to inhale all the cigarette smoke on the way to your nonsmoking room."

I thought the $60/person buffet was horrific. Don't go there.  I got the worst cut of UNCOOKED Rib Eye steak ever seen and when I asked them to cook it the chef's attitude was horrific"
377," they hate you unless you eat uncooked meat. Plus, the hide the beef so you can't see it. At $60, avoid this buffet and go to a nice restaurant"

It would have been nice to be informed that checkout is actually between 4-6pm and that there is an additional fee to check in early.  Also, by paying the $33 for an early check in it would have been nice to have an exact time we would have a room. We just waited around until 11am."
379,"눉
Staff were mostly off hand. Everything in the room has to be paid for, including the coffee and water - lifting anything off the tray means an automatic addition to the bill. The room was a bit tired and the towels shabby. The girls bringing drinks to people in the Casino looked bored and sometimes scruffy, their white 'togas' were poorly fitting and looked cheap. Disappointed, the hotel didn't live up to our expectations."

No correlation between the first price and the actual price. Many taxes and resort fee
The spa is for additional money!!!!
The ""complementary"" water cost 7 dollars."

I would suggest that they put wineglasses in the room. Simple boxes of peanuts  were $22 a bit ridiculous.   Small wine bottles in room very expensive and no wine glasses?   I would suggest they improve on the housekeeping.  Ice buckets were not emptied from the previous evening."

Massively overpriced for what you get, really disappointed that the pool area was closed and what was worse when I went to complain staff on reception weren't aware and just to top it off the ignorant reception supervisor just shrugged it off and said "" we always close it at this time of the year"" we stayed the previous night at the Aria hotel for half the money with heated outdoor pools, don't waste your money its massively overrated"
