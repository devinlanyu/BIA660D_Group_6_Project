0,"It is not a family friendly hotel, I asked for a kettle to warm by baby's milk and they charged USD 10 for it. The amount is not much when you are staying at this hotel but you find it very ridiculous."
1,"Hotel was far too big. Was too hectic and wasn’t easy to get to the lifts to get up to your suite! Also, hated the fact people can smoke inside! Could smell smoke on our floor and we hate the smell of people smoking!"
2,"I mean it's Vegas, everything is expensive and to go anywhere you have to walk through a Casino. It take forever just to go from the room to the strip."
3,NOTHING
4,Every staff member in the casino area (excluding cocktail servers) we tried to approach were extremely rude
5,In room advertisement on what I believe was an internal hotel channel of a young woman soliciting viewers offering intimate communications was offensive.
6,"Had to call housekeeping in the evening as the room wasn’t made
Breakfast included is a rip off, you had better go and have breakfast at McDonald than take that option 
Paid extra charge at check in to have a view of the strip, we had a view of Trump tower..."
7,39 Dollar resort fee a night dies not give you access tithe spa - not even the simplest saunaYou walk miles in this hotel - badly organized Staff is alright but not first classHotel apart from the architecture is not much different or unique than most other Strip hotels
8,First room not cleaned properly and smelled of tobacco. Switched rooms and new room was great
9,The fridge should have room for our personal items. And no coffee maker. And lamps near bed should have plug outlet.
10,"Everything at the Venetian was exceeded our expectations. The only downside was the check-in experience. The Venetian had not received the reservation we had made through Booking and we had to wait for Booking to resolve the issue with their reservations department. After an hour wait, the Venetian was nice enough to give us a room at a much cheaper rate than the one booked through Booking while Booking worked on our reservation, which they were able to solve about 3 hours after hour arrival. It may not seem important but after traveling for 20+ hours check-in experience is almost as important as the stay itself.  This is the first time I had issues with Booking but I received not apology or compensation for such a hassle."
11,"Be aware that most US hotels and especially in Las Vegas will charge you for the room even though booking.com lists these as ""free cancellation"".  The cancellation may be free but your room will get charged and receiving a credit for the charge takes days (in most cases).  This has happened to me now several times and it is very inconvenient when I have to ""argue"" with the hotel reception about removing the ""deposit"" charge because the room was intended to be held with one credit card and paid by another. This time at the Venetian the receptionist insisted that the charge had been made by booking.com and that the room was prepaid and could not changed.  Only after speaking to his manager the prepayment (which was charged by The Venetian) was removed.  But it will now take several days until my credit card is refunded. Maybe booking.com has this point listed in small print somewhere, but advertising these rooms as ""free cancellation"" does not really paint the whole picture.  Outside of the United States the ""free cancellation"" works exactly as noted.  And probably one of the main reasons I continue to book my hotels through booking.com."
12,"The view from the room could have been better, there is an option to upgrade to get the better view however."
13,"Given the price, I expected at least complementary water but none was provided. Minibar was weighted, so you couldn't take anything out if you wanted to store your own stuff as you would get charged. Sometimes the smell of smoke from the casino floor would reach the room."
14,"Poor signs from self parking to main reception, especially due to the size of the hotel."
15,"It was a bit hard to get in and out of the hotel. We had to take two elevators and cross a bridge :) . Same with the Casino, hard to find the exit, but I'm pretty sure that one is on purpose. The room didn't have any slippers which I think is very basic for such a hotel. Towels were super rough and hurt my skin."
16,"If I had to be super picky, and I am being picky, for a luxury hotel:- seats in the Venetian reception area would be good for those with mobility issues to take a rest whilst checking in- the one area that wasn't clean in the room were the phones, covered in dust but there again these aren't used as much I suspect these days- am not a fan of the in room minibar on a weighted tray.- no complimentary water or coffee machine- small, upright in room safe. Would prefer a larger, flat laptop sized safe- towels are small (especially after you've eaten all the good food downstairs!)"
17,Lady at the dront desk was a little aggressive about our view of the room. Our view ended up looking at the AC system of the building. We had 2 rooms and she said they are right accors each other and they were not! but luckily we were in the same floor! Cut restaurant in same resort was terrible! I felt like I eat a charcoal when I asked for a well done steak and it does NOT worth the money you pay
18,Nothing. It will be hard to find something one do not like here.
19,That I had to go home!
20,"No respect to the clients. Will not recommend at all and will not be back. I can explain why.  I stayed in hotel 3 days. I paid total about 1200$, so 400$ per day. And you guys can't provide bath slippers for your clients for this amount? Really? I was so surprised about it after moved in, i made a call on reception to say that there is no slippers, and answer was ""they are not supposed to be there"". Really? For 400$ per day i have to go to bath and then walk on the dirty floor without the slippers? Okay, they said ""we gonna deliver it by your request, wait please 15 min"". I was waiting, and nothing was happen in 30 min, i get to shower, i get out of shower and just then, in 50 min totally i get my slippers) even in cheap 3 stars hotel they providing it, i just can't understand why Venezian acting with no respect and so cheap. Second reason that makes me disappointed even more, its additional charges. After moved in I realized that there is no water heater inside as well, i need it for my special herbal tea. I got a call on front desk and they say ""it's not include but you can get it for 7.50$"". So, i paid to Venezian 7.50$ plus tips to rent a water heater that totally cost on market even less than 7.50$) Nice move guys. So, of course problem not in 7.50$, thanks God i can handle it, problem in respect that you not feel at all from Venezian staff, especially when you ordering lux room for that amount of money. I know that it's all about business but there is tonns of ways to make money beside to safe it on slippers, they cost less than 50 cents... p.s. Thank you for not charging me for the air."
21,"Our view wasn't the best, despite booking a strip view room. It is a smoking casino and the smell of smoke gets into the corridors and elevators. Not good for non smokers"
22,"Outdated furniture, no coffee maker/ keurig. No view of the Stip. wanted additional $45 to get a View. I paid less in other hotels with the strip view."
23,"Having to walk through the casino to get to the room elevator banks.  The smell of smoke in the casinos, but that's Vegas."
24,Be prepared to spend a lot for food and activities if you stay mostly in the resort.
25,"We used the minibar to store our bottles of water. It was small, so we had to move the bottles inside. Because of that, the system mistakingly identified that we had opened a bottle of champagne, and charged $55. Fortunately, at checkout they confirmed if we did that (which we didn't), and reimbursed my credit card."
26,"It's so big, it takes about 5 minutes to walk to your room from the entrance :)"
27,"I mean this is not Encore and not brand new, but I don't see the appeal of Bellagio when price difference is so much"
28,"Staff was very rude. My wife asked for kettle to heat up water for my 1 year old. We were told by the staff,""I don't know where all you have stayed before, but at The Venetian we charge for kettle"". I was happy to pay the charge, without them making such rude remarks."
29,"It does not feel like a 5* Hotel at any point, more like an average 4*.
The reception staff (as well as the hotel via email) was quite pushy asking us to upgrade and since we didn’t feel the need we ended up at the back of the hotel directly on top of the casino vent which made an insufferable 24h noise making impossible to sleep. While the host that did our check in was ok, the attitude of the rest of the staff by the reception (not attending at that point) was childish, noisy and definitely not what you expect from a 5* Hotel where you expect everything to be mint end to end.
The rooms are very big and astonishing, though the electric curtains on our room didn’t work. The bathroom is huge but the toilet doors didn’t close properly...it’s in general quite worn out. In terms of room amenities you expect in a 4*+ Hotel you will not fond here. Nothing to polish your shoes, no toothbrush, no paste, no comb, no razor...really nothing! The hairdryer is as powerful as the battery on my watch so bring you own if you want my advice. 
The icing in the cake for me was the pool being closed for the season! The resort fee for the Venetian/Palazzo is the highest of the Strip yet all the other hotels down the strip had the full resort and pools open and heated and the Venetian didn’t, very disappointing. 
All in all, we were in Vegas for our honeymoon and wanted to treat ourselves going to “the best”...probably should have gone for the sure bets!"
30,"Couldn't connect to their internet.  Didn't want to wait on hold for IT when on vacation so went without internet.  Still it is nice to get away from the digital world.  However if paying a 39 dollar a day resort fee, I think the IT could be a little faster.  Maybe a little better education at check in."
31,"I booked this hotel on booking.com , which includes breakfast everyday. I paid about AUD$60 per day for this breakfast and I was expecting a buffet or at least a continental breakfast.However I was kicked out of the restaurant in the first morning because the AUD$60 breakfast only includes 4 mini muffins and a tiny fruit salad X 2.  I felt so pissed off.  In the next morning, it was even worse as there was no staff at the restaurant door to give me the AUD$60 mini muffins. I went into the this restaurant, to order a hot buffet breakfast . You know what? It was only USD$20 each. I complained to booking.com and its customer service sucks. One email said she will reply to me within 7 days, and then no more response in 2 weeks until I contacted book.com again and again. Booking.com denied any responsibility of any booking on its website and refuse to give refund of the overcharged breakfast."
32,"The breakfast option in the room charge was for TWO people regardless of how many are staying and consists of a ""grab and go"" Danish/fruit cup/coffee for two. No flexibility but fine if you like this style."
33,"Wifi very poor in rooms and throughout hotel, dirty plates left outside our door for hours. Our room key became faulty every night of our stay and we were sat outside our hotel room waiting for security to issue a new key for up to 20mins. No bottle opener in room despite there being a mini bar. In the grand scheme, there's are small issues but when you pay so much to stay there it is unacceptable."
34,My only complaint is having to walk through the smoke-filled casino to reach our room. Yuck!
35,"Housekeeping a bit slow, had to ask to have room done already after 3pm. Properly huge - confusing to navigate.Disappointed that we couldn’t upgrade room."
36,"The hotel is too big and doesn't work for people that have trouble walking long distance like my mom, very crowded. Located almost at the end of the strip"
37,The valet parking was very unfriendly
38, valet drivers were standing idly in the center and failing to provide basic guidance (as compared to Palazzo).
39,Too much smoke in the casino.  Non-smokers need their own area to breathe easier.
40,Such a long way to find the check in counter and the hotel room. Poor breakfast. No coffee maker in room
41,There was nothing not to like! It was a great hotel!
42,The room is quite dark. Checkin wait is usually long.
43,Breakfast was include in Booking.com but there was no enough information about the breakfast. I saw details about the breakfast after confirmation. It was to late to cancel the breakfast.
44,"The toilet paper was horrendous. I have had better TP at the local park. Also, there is no coffee maker in the room.I got charged $95 because I picked something up from the dresser. Apparently there are weight sensors on the tray and you get charged anytime you pick an item up (regardless of whether you actually used it). I had to call the front desk to have the charge removed. I was woke up in the middle of the night by someone's toilet flushing in the next room and by loud, crude guests in the hallway. I was uneasy about how clearly I could hear their basic conversations as I tried to fall back asleep.I paid an extra $45 for a ""Strip view"" which consisted of a bunch of roofs and less than half a block of the strip where nothing was actually happening.This hotel is all looks and no real substance. It was absolutely not worth the money. Next time I will stay at the Bellagio."
45,"Parking lot no surveillance cameras, because my car was hit in the parking lot and the incitee escaped，let me feel bad😡"
46,"1. The breakfast was really disappointing (for extra 47 GBP for two nights to get three tiny pastries in the paper box and a paper cup of tea/coffee which you have to pick up from the bakery as takeaway without even possibility to sit and eat properly for such high class hotel as The Venetian was very very very disappointing - never book breakfast included in your room rate there).2. The thing that mini bar and some snacks & drinks at the table are electronically controlled makes check out easier, but the matter that you are charged even if you took it to check and then placed back is a bit anoying.3. No complimentary water in the room, even branded with the hotel name 0,5l water bottle is charged.4. There weren't slippers in the room, which is kind of ok for lower rated hotels, but for The Venetian!..."
47,No room in refrigerator for personal use..would have loved coffee facilities in room.
48,The maids woke me up twice at 11am and 11:30am when I had 6pm late checkout.
49,"When I booked the suite ( which was very expensive) i was expecting a view , which didn´t had , when I booked it on booking, the photos showed there was a view, I felt a lil scammed by this."
50,The smoke.  The bedrooms also had a smoke smell.  If it is the “filtered” air then they need to figure a different way to recycle the air.  Will not be able to return because of the smoke.
51,Left turn traffic light outside self parking drive way is tooo slow. Every time need to wait for a long time especially heavy traffic.
52,"No space in there mini fridge for personal use .  You move the item in the mini bar, you .No coffee pot or tea for early or late night drink, you have to order and PAY.I wanted to borrow 2 small plates and fork,  I was told I'll be charged for this service. ( they forgot, the charged $39 resort fee per night) and. Since they busy, I have to wait for one hour.We were in the non- smoking area rooms but at night, we can smell the cigarettes smoke."
53,It is a very big hotel and confusing to get around.
54,"For breakfast we got some food in a box to take it with us, we hoped we could sit down in a restaurant for the money we payed."
55,The service received from the bellman & valet when leaving the property were horrible.
56,allowing pets .
57,Breakfast! Well below my expectations for a five star hotel. A bag of danishes to take away to your room or to find a place to eat. Parking was a nightmare. Hard to find a spot on your own and 15 minutes to an hour wait to get your car from valet.
58,We saw last guest left their shopping bags and trash inside the closet...so we called the house keeping. They shows up quickly and clean up immediately.
59,"The breakfast included is a joke, you don’t have any choice for what to choose and it is totally not worth it. Don’t choose the room with breakfast included."
60,The room was non smoking. We reported a horrible cigarette smoke smell in the toilet room and the hotel brought an air filter. It did not work. Still smelled badly.
61,One bad thing is the speech of wifi. It is too slow to watch videos.
62,We had wanted to spend some time at the spa but it seems to book up quick for couples retreats.
63,Really wish Las Vegas would enforce a smoking ban inside the casinos.
64,"As a suite, the living room side is not very useful as it is completely open to the bedroom.  Just a very large hotel room and not really a suite where one can go and not disturb another.  The furniture in the living room are was not very comfortable.  I also can't believe the sensor mini bars still exist and was disappointed to see this hotel had this type of system.  You can not look at anything or read ingredients to see if you want it as if you move it you bought it.  Very cheap toilet paper, stiff robe, cheap toiletries and useless hair dryer for the price you pay for this hotel.  In Vegas you can get good accommodations for much more reasonable price.  Expected a little more for the cost of this hotel but was pretty standard to an average hotel.  In the Canal shops you are harassed constantly by people trying to sell you show tickets or drag you into their cosmetics shops and put their crap on you.  Was very annoying and hated whenever we had to walk through the canal shops to the room and could not just leisurely walk around and shop without aggressive sales people constantly coming after you."
65,"A little desappointed by some services, that are usually free in a hotel of this class. No free bottle of water (even small!!) has been offered in the room, what is definitely not normal!!"
66,Would be greater if more direction guidance could be given because it’s a little bit confusing between the Casino and the main entrance.
67,I drove with the Tesla to The Venetian and I asked for it to be charged and it didn’t happend . The valet told me he can charg it for me but he didn’t do it .
68,"The Check-in staff were not nice, originally gave us the wrong room, gave us the wrong directions to our room. When we went back to straighten it out, they did nothing to compensate us for all our lost time, frustration and hassle."
69,- 1 ply toilet paper-  view of the car park- staff wasn't friendly at Check in or Check out - mini bar was so packed that we couldn't fridge our own waters
70," if we had removed the bottles in the fridge we would've been charged (electronic minibar)- expected more luxury as advertised online - all the pools were shut even though it was 30C- no complimentary coffee/tea with kettle as usual in most hotel rooms- 7$ delivery fee, min. order and resort fee on top of room service-150$ resort fee that was supposed to be included ended up not working at one of the advertised restaurants"
71,It says rate includes BREAKFAST which is actually a con. What it should say is - small take away bag of pastries and coffee. A proper cooked breakfast will cost you a minimum of another $50. This is very poor and people should be warned !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
72,Good and beverages are very expensive.
73,"Long way form the parking lot to the lobby, and back to the room."
74,No buffet breakfastComplimentary water in the room would really help. Also electric kettle as our kids were not well and wanted hot water to drink.
75,Because we arrived at 12 and check in not til 3pm they charged an extra $45 PER NIGHT for the early check in. Thought it was an upgrade but room was exactly the same as other suits.
76,Booked a high room with a king sized bed. Got a middle floor with 2 queen sized beds as all available king sized rooms were on smoking floors.
77,Absolutely nothing
78,I was not told that during check-in I need to deposit $100 cash. Also I don't know why they don't use my card details on booking.com. So I had to pay $479 during check-in.
79,Window view. I was told it was strip view.. it was not ! I hated seeing TRUMP HOTEL!
80,"i asked front desk for kettle,a staff said she would send someone bring it to my room. I'd been waiting for whole day,they still didn't come！！and next day i asked another staff about that, they said they didn't have the record of my order!! what's wrong with your staff!! If the staff doesn't want to help me, she can send another staff to help me.DO NOT LIED TO YOUR CUSTOMER！！"
81,Nothing
82,"No big complaints. It's a large building so a little confusing sometimes on which way to go, but there are signs everywhere to help guide you."
83,1. There is no tea or coffee making facilities forcing you to get dressed and go buy it which is very poor for five star one would expect an espresso machine in the room for the price2. The mini bar did not allow you to move items to store your own3. The actual bath was quite small but two people can squeeze into it4. The buildings are too tall which creates shaded pools and difficulty to sit in the sunshine
84,Very long corridors and the view rooms don't have much of a view. Spend your money somewhere else. This place acts like they do you a favor by letting you stay there. Look at the bottom sections of the doors as you trek one of those long hallways.
85,The lower flours smelt like sewer so our first room on the 8th floor stank and we had to move at 2am to another room on the 24th floor.
86,"The 1st suite I walked into the room and it was filthy and I walked into coffee and pashio shells all over the place so we had to move to a different room, then we got food poisoning the next morning from the in house cook from the sausage.I missed half of the Michael Jackson One Show because of my diahrea and going to the bathroom so much and they wouldn't even compensate us for the show. Just $150 towards the room and took the whole weekend off. But it was my boyfriends 50th birthday and I called ahead to set up 50 black and silver balloons and then 1 50 marlar balloon. They couldn't even get that right never signed my name to the card nor did he get the 50 marlar balloon. I was crying by then and so was he the whole weekend was ruined. We were treated like King and Queen at the Mandalay Bay and will go there next time. The only person that saved the weekend was Monique and Johnathan."
87,"The room was dirty ( we had hairs in our shower and there was dust everywhere) The staff was not welcoming and not helpful and we had to wait long periods of time : it took us almost 2 hours to check in, we waited half an hour on the phone before we reached the front desk...Not what you expect from a 5 star hotel..."
88,Check in receptionist offered upgrade which was completely unnecessary for a couple. Problem quickly rectified to our satisfaction through central bookings in hotel.
89,The air-conditioning was bad in another word the room was not cool enough at night.And i got to mention the cleanness of the room was not good we checked in with an empty bottle on the floor adding the housekeeping afterward was not as a 5 star hotel would be.
90,"I didn’t like that Booking.com charged $30 more than the actual Resort. Do not book with Booking.com without going to the Resorts website first. Had I booked with the Resort, not only would I have saved $30, but there was also a $150 Resort credit I missed out on for not booking directly."
91,"the walk to 2 sets of elevators was poor, No coffee or water in the room for $39 resort rate n my $200 / night. the pool was stupid no sun small , the food was very expensive i mostly had to eat at wintergreens. sportsbook football odds were too high."
92,Swimming pool is average. Pricing is steep especially after adding resort fees and taxes. Refundable deposit of  about usd 50 per day.
93,"Bathroom light fixtures although beautiful were bright enough, nor were there enough of them.   On closer inspection there could be a more thorough cleaning.  The  curtains surrounding the back  around the bed had layers of dust in between the folds.  As well there was dust on the top of the headboard.  Also a little bit of mold in the stand up shower."
94,There really wasn’t much to choose from to eat after a certain time inside the hotel.
95,The view overlooked the back of the hotel which looked as though it was the top of the garage
96, the phones did not work until maintenance was informed
97, found an empty water bottle on check in
98,"Charged 50 USD extra per day for a view, got a narrow stripe of nothing in particular = robbery at broad daylight! Hotel layout a nightmare, only bright side of constantly getting lost is getting lots of exercise!"
99,A knock on the door for a room check at 8.30 amIf a long night before it’s too early to be woken up.
100,"The WiFi was very poor, speed was ridiculously slow considering it is 2017! A smartphone with a LTE connection would be faster. You could upgrade to 5Mbps!! This is still woefully slow!"
101,"Slow housekeeping. My son got sick from eating bad pizza from the food court and threw up the whole night. Had to call housekeeping a few times to get somebody to clean the room. Even then, housekeepers did a haphazard job at cleaning the puke, changing sheets. We fell asleep waiting, and they knocked past midnight to bring in extra linens we had requested a while back! The following day, they didn’t come until the Afernoon to take care of our puke-ridden room. So overnight we slept in puky sheets and dealt with puky smell. Well onto the next day."
102,"Casino very smoky. Not used to this in Europe any more. Don't even lift anything off the mini bar, you may be charged."
103,"Breakfast was TERRIBLE! What a ripoff to pay extra through your booking site, Booking.com, for pastries and fruit. That was enough to make me book directly through hotels in the future instead of your site. The hotel staff told me they have had several complaints about your “Grab and Go” breakfast. We didn’t even pick them up but we were charged for them, and the hotel can’t reverse the charges or change the order. There is no way to address the problem with Booking.com."
104,I did not like that the lack of a coffee maker in the room....having to go downstairs to buy coffee or pay about $30 for a pot to be brought up.  The fridge had no room for our food because it was sensor pricing all the space with hotel priced beverages.
105,"Too much rush at the Check-in counters but the staff were very efficient. Huge hotel, so lots of walking from the main entrance to the room(s) via two lifts."
106,"When you advertise ""including Breakfast"" it is NOT acceptable to get a voucher for a pick up breakfast (2 cups of coffee, 3 pieces of pastry) for 2 persons when we have booked for 4. This is a lousy excuse for a breakfast! Very Poor service and information from Booking.com"
107,"Breakfast was part of the room rate. Was disappointed to know, the included breakfast was a take away breakfast box with some pastries and few pieces of fruits. There was no kettle or tea bags or coffee in the room."
108,"My sister got bed bug bites on her neck and shoulder. She contacted the hotel on Oct 10 and has not heard from them at all regarding this. Also, we arrived to our room  one night at midnight and our room was not serviced. We had to call for towels. The beds were not made. I will report this to the vagas health dept."
109,"Not much, but never got breakfast. Really annoying and sneaky 'Resort fee' of U$40+ per day was added to bill on checkout. It's a really cheap trick that does the hotel no credit. But for the hotel it does the job of making the room rate look more affordable. Supposedly pays for extras like Wifi etc, although these are advertised as 'Free'. Not sure if this 'fee' would be considered legal anywhere but Vegas. Unwary travellers on a tight budget be aware you are going to be hit with this additional bill as well as local taxes. One of the top hotels in Vegas - at a price that's acceptable but unfortunately one that's not always up front."
110,"Poor value for money. We booked a brakefast included offer, and what we got was a 15 min line every morning, just to get a box with 2 old pastries. All pool areas are smoking areas so if you dont like lungs cancer you should only be in your room, and the wifi works only in the room. We regret coming here. after visiting many 5 stars hotels all over the world, this one was extremely disappointing"
111,"We asked for quiet room, as we have 2 years old baby and we got connected room and in that other room were very noisy guests. There was also food smell from the restsurant through A/C.. After 1. night they changed us the room, but we got one near the elevators, which were also noisy throught these paper walls..But the worst was breakfast. When we were booking our stay, there was written , we will have continental breakfast.. After booking we reciebed confirmation email, where was writyen, that breakfast will be Grab and go! The quality of such breakfast is very poor../3small pasteries and bit of fruit..you waiting in lane to get sime boxes and you have to leave no seating at all). After complaining they deducted a tax resort fee from the bill and we have to find breakfast on out own. You just dont expect this from 5* hotel eventually the receptionist said its only 4*."
112,There is nothing negative I can say about the Venetian
113,"There were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. First night they tried to charge us for lots of contents from mini bar, which we didn't even open. But they deducted this off our bill when we highlighted it."
114,"My room rate is over $300 per night with tax and resort fee. First night late check in around 10pm and they dont have the room type that I booked for. Second night went back to hotel after whole day trip, found that the room wasn't clean up at all. I called and asked for house keeping ASAP then still wait for more than an hour still have no one come. I eventually went down and request a room change! I live in LA and went to vegas quite often, but I don't think I will stay in venitien anymore."
115,"The check in was slow even at 11pm, no special congratulations for our 10 wedding anniversary, even told the checking staff directly, we got engaged at the Venetian 11 years ago, so coming back was special, will not be returning."
116,"Nothing spectacular but an electric plug next to the bedroom would be nice to charge cell phone. Otherwise, the best hotel on the Strip I've ever seen so far."
117,"We were very surprised that the janitors do not wash floors and vacuum the floors!  I had to crawl under the bed to pick up a dropped item, where I found some items of the previous tenants and some much dust..."
118,"Staff very unhelpful and rude, breakfast £250 and not actually included just take away coffee and danish that cannot be eaten inside the hotel!!!!"
119,"I didn't enjoy the room to the fullest, I was out all the time"
120,"Under a medical emergency it took to long for someone to get there on the casino floor. A guest was unresponsive, it appeared lack of on site first responders,  AED not provided. Employed apeEd confused and none assisting  Within first hour, Power in room went out &  toilet broke ( repair response was fast)"
121,"The room was advertised as offering free breakfast with the stay. The ""breakfast"" consisted of a cardboard box containing three small pure sugar pastries and a tiny pot of fresh fruit. You were also given a cup of weak filter coffee. The real joy was that you were not even given anywhere to sit and consider how pitiful it was - the restaurant handling the promo where you picked it up reserving it's empty seats for more important guests. On a room costing 650 usd after taxes this was disgraceful. The staff at the Venetian politely explained that they received regular complaints about this promo - and occasionally they considered passing the complaints on, but basically it wasn't their problem. As a paying customer who booked through an agent they weren't interested in whether you enjoyed your stay. And they were not receptive to my suggestion of explaining to guests that the breakfast deal would be disappointing - And that the guest should make alternative plans. They were extremely courteous- but really couldn't have cared less."
122,The breakfast provided was almost all carbs and as I don't eat them was useless. Only ate small carton of fruit. I asked if they could offer an alternative but they said it was arranged between booking.com and the cafe so NO.
123,"Upon entering the room we were greeted with a floor that had recently (same day) been washed. Although I appreciate they wash it, the carpet to the room we were given was still completely wet and the furniture was on the beds, their was a large noisy fan with a long extension cord connected to try and dry it. When we reported this they offered to come take fan out, which wouldn't of helped, the fan was needed to try and dry the carpet, but they did not offer or even allow us to switch rooms. We had to stay in a room with a wet carpet, unbelievable. Also, they gave us a room credit when we booked (this wasn't given to us because of the wet carpet, it was a booking promo offer), then at check out they were not honoring it. It became a big hassle (almost an hour to check out, straightening the issue). Fortunately that part was resolved. But over all our hotel was not what we had expected for the quality of hotel we thought we were getting. Very disappointed with staff and their unwillingness to be more helpful or accommodating."
124,No coffee/ tea making facilities in the room. Fridge full of minibar so can't be used for your own drinks.
125,"The problem was not with the property, but with Booking.com. The ""included breakfast"" is a joke. It is not through the hotel, but a 3rd party vendor. It is NOT room service, but a lunch counter where you can ""grab and go."" NOT worth the extra money. Annoyed that booking.com was misleading. Could have gotten the same rate on the hotel website with room service options. Live and learn."
126,nothing
127,"the breakfast -
i ordered and paid for a room with ""breakfast included"". when i asked about the the breakfast i got vague answers and only after morning arrived i understood why. 
i was a expecting the usual breakfast buffet or at an omlette but instead
people that have breakfast included wait in a very unclear, unorganized  seperate line at the grand lux cafe to find out they get a very cheap cheap ""to go"" bag with 2-3 pastries and some coffee. not even a place a place to sit just ""take your pitty breakfast bag and get out of here"".
if you want the morning buffet its 20$ per person (excl tax) .
even the person they put in charge of providing these pastry bag fwlt uncomfortable and kept saying sorry to all the shocked hotel visitors that had the breakfast voucher.
it is a very unexpected humilating, even insulting, joke from such a high end hotel.
so If you decide to go with the venitian, order a suite Without breakfast included and get it somewhere else"
128,Everything is charged. Even a kettle has delivery charge to be sent to your room. And we were welcomed with hair in the bathroom.
129,Customer service at the front desk I booked this trip for a birthday and anniversary At the beginning in the check in we didn't got the room I ordered Asked for a non smoking high flor with view And got a smoking whit no view and not in high level We where tired and went to the roomIt was almost 12:00 at night We couldn't fall a sleep it smelled very bed Even the bed sheets where sticky from cigarettes I don't think they where replaced!!!In a  while  We went the next morning to the desk to ask for a different room he took them the whole day to give us a room then eventually turn out not so good well yes they gave us non-smoking high-level but the bathroom was dirty and full lWith  hairs  Again the next morning we went to the desk and they replaced the room to non-smoking but low level  Until we reach the room the key wasn't working we waited 25 minutes for nobody to show so we went back to the desk to get a key I want to ask a question is this a joke or whatThey only compensated us by canceling the  resort fees and gave us another hundred dollar to use At the hotel I think that it's a disgrace and we should not be charged at all hope that someone will hear about it it was my wife's 40 years old birthday very disappointing
130,"huge hotel , takes time to get use to itevery thing cost money..parking , coffee etcno coffee machine in the roomour room door was broken and took a while to fix it and in the mean time our children were stuck outside for a while  , we didn't get any apologize from the hotel"
131,Nothing really. The two minor problems were sorted. The mini bar is hugely expensive rendering it pointless. If you want breakfast in bed then sell your house...
132,"No tea / coffee in room.The complex can bery disorientating due to its size and confusing layout. There are over 4,000 rooms on this hotel."
133,"We hadn't appreciated how pricey everything was going to be! The room was lovely, but didn't have the 'wow' factor that we thought we were going to have given the price we paid. Every ATM wants to charge $8 for withdrawals (which we were relying on given our prepaid card) and we soon found that everywhere was pretty pricey for food, drinks etc."
134,"It took hours to receive our luggage. The sofffa bed had dirty sheets. They tried to compensate us, but when you come for one night it really ruined the experience. The person that finally brought our luggage was very helpful."
135,Our upgrade to a strip view room was only a part view. Spa was way too overpriced.
136,"No drink making facilities in the suite and no complimentary water, which for the price was poor we thought."
137,Needed more umbrellas on the 3rd floor pool area.
138,Majority of the Casino staff.Unwillingness to be polite to younger guests.
139,"room keys never worked on the first time (I had 3), could be stood a few minutes outside my room, keep trying the key."
140,It's impossible to reach someone from the front desk via phone. I was waiting on line for more than 30 min and hung up.
141,We didn't realise smoking was allowed inside in the gambling areas.  No matter how good the AC is it still drifts into non smoking areas.
142,"Expensive for food and water in hotel, lots of extra fees, constant people shouting at you about timeshares - shouldn't be in a hotel it made it very frustrating(screaming down a hallway at you)"
143,Nothing
144,As always never enough sunbeds by the pool.
145,"The hotel is just a massive money making machine, no kettle or coffee making facilities in the room, no usable fridge in the room but a fridge could be hired for 25 dollers a day and tea or coffee could be ordered up to the room for a cost plus 7 dollers delivery charge!Upon arrival the first thing we was asked was would we like to upgrade the room at an extra cost, which when you have paid a lot of money already for your room puts a downer on things before you have even seen the room."
146,very expensive rate (daily average  500$) without BF.paid for resort fee (30$ daily - most of Vegas hotels have resort fee)valet parking long Que - 15 to 20 minutes to get your car.
147,"For the price I expected more. There was nothing included in the hotel price, not even a comp for the casino. And the decor was clearly a few decades old. The hotel is enormous and got quite loud at night, and we got lost several times."
148,No coffee or tea facilities in the room.
149,"Only one downfall.  This cannot be a statement just for the Venetian, but coming from a smoke free country, it is a let down to see that smoking is allowed throughout the whole hotel."
150,Not very friendly!  Not the cleanest hotel !  Way overrated !  And if you like  breathing smoke no matter where you're at that's the place to go !  Sure don't feel very safe even in your own hotel !
151,"The bar and refrigerator are on a weight system. DO NOT TAKE ANYTHING OFF OF YOU WILL BE CHARGED. Unless you want to pay $10 for a handful of Mixed Nuts. If you want a larger ice bucket for your room, they charge you for a larger ice bucket."
152,"Bed was used/messed up when we arrived, that really spoiled the ""wow""-effect, I had hoped for, when upgrading to a room at 36th floor with a strip-view.Also the pool area was closed because it rained => very disappointed kids.Everything is extremely expensive, at the resort (e.g. 11$ for a cup of coffee from the local cafe)"
153,"On 3/4/27, We called security office when our car battery died. Security on phone said they're battery charger was not working and couldn't assist us. My husband was calling roadside assistance, when 2 bike security men rode up on and offered us assistance.  One security went to get a battery charger and helped us boost our car battery. These two security guards riding their bikes came to our aid while the security on the phone didn't do anything to help us."
154,No coffee pot in room????? what's up with that?called room service in morning for coffee and 45 minute wait..had to get dressed and go down to coffee bean.will def bring my own coffee pot next visit.this is the first hotel i'v stayed at with the coffee issue.very disappointed
155,Coffee making machine in the room would be perfect
156,"Expensive, even charged for a bottle of water in the room. Stayed at the MGM and Bellagio, neither charge for water. Wouldn't stay at the Venetian again!"
157,The players club staff were the only downfall to the Venetian.
158,"Rooms smelt of smoke, staff were unfriendly, very few complimentary items in the room i.e. no kettle or coffee.  Felt very sparse for 5* hotel."
159,"Everything was perfect. We had some noisy neighbors and the moved us to another suite, so there was no problem at all."
160,The prices for the wet bar in the room! I think those prices were outrageous.
161,"We found the weight-sensitive charging of items from the minibar (used or not) quite distasteful and we were too scared to go anywhere near it. Directions from the lobby to the lifts were not clear. After flying from London and checking in at 1:30am, housekeeping woke us up by entering our room at 9:00am."
162,"No coffee maker in the room, and most hotels have free bottle of water every day. Not much staff walking around if you have questions, so you have to go to check in area to find personnel.  Casino staff had no idea where things were"
163,Hated the shower - awful water pressure and shower heads - NO vent fan in toilet room ( this is just gross ) linens we not enough .. I think they leave limited so you need to call for more and would have to tip more often .. It is all set up for you to pay more and more ..
164,Generally expensive but it was New Year's Eve. Had to complain about the worn out room in the Venetian Tower before they moved us to the Pallazzo Tower. Long queues during check-in.
165,Room service took  2.5 hours on a Thursday morning for 2 meals.Ordered only drinks on Friday morning took over an hour to deliver a glass of oj and coffee.Had our driver take us cracker barrel @ 8 miles away and had the meal and returned in the same amount of time.We come to LV @ once a month and stay a quite a few different properties.Venetian was a top choice...We will never stay here again.
166,"The resort fee is annoying because you don't expect it, why not just tell us the full price, or charge for additional amenities"
167," we didn't use the pool etc why pay for it? It's irrelevant but also disappointing that Sheldon Adelson owns these hotels and as such right wing hate is supported by the hotel, but he owns pretty much half the strip so kind of hard to avoid him!It gets crowded at times because the hotel is such a sight to see."
168,"Charged me twice for my stay ($4,000) causing my bank account to be frozen for over a week. Denied having done so. Completely destroyed any good things I'd have had to say. Outrageous behaviour."
169,"Had to walk a quarter of a mile from front desk to room each time, fridge was packed with hotel items could not use it for yourself, absolutely no view as a A/C unit was outside the window."
170,The purchase of postage stamps was so difficult that I went to Walgreens to purchase them.  The front desk should be able to supply this service and know how much it costs to mail a postcard to another country.
171,"(1) No baby crib availableI contacted The Venetian through Booking.com where I booked my rooms, and tried to reserve a baby crib for my 8-month daughter about 15 days before we arrive at The Venetian. However, I was told that reservation is not available.When we checked-in on Dec. 24 , no crib is available. In the 2nd day's morning (Dec. 25), I visited Front-Desk, and tried to reserve a baby crib again. The Front-Desk called related department, and put my name in the waiting list. However, the crib is still unavailable after we checked out.  (2) No free drink water provided in the roomI stayed several hotels, and most of them will provide free 2 bottles of dink water every day. It doesn't cost too much, but let the customer feel better. Furthermore, there is no vending machine in the passage. (3) My room is assigned to other guests before my check-out !!!I contacted Front-desk twice (Dec. 26 night and Dec. 27 morning), and requested extended check-out at 2:00pm, because my flight is at 4:55pm. The lady at front-desk told me that both of my rooms have been extended to 2:00pm without any additional charge. However, when I went back my rooms at 1:15pm Dec. 27, one of rooms was already occupied by other guests !! My door card became invalid. You know, I didn't checked out my rooms at that time. How could you assign my rooms to other guests? There might be my personal stuffs inside the room! I am very disappointed!  I am not sure whether I missed any thing, since I didn't count every detail in my baggage.Overall, my stay at The Venetian is quite unsatisfactory."
172,"I will never book through booking.com, it was a nightmare , I had to pay $35 extra each night because I requested one king  room and a one queen room. Booking .com failed to change the reservation, I had to change to the palazzo hotel because the Venetian doesn't have queen rooms, it was my twin sister and my birthday and we planned this trip in august 2016 and the result was we ended in separate hotels."
173,Tea facilities could be offered without additional charge- kettle only on offer no tea or coffee with it. No slippers in the room (not like last time I stayed here) Our property was taken out of the room without our consent and I had an ordeal to get some satisfaction. Still no word from the hotel on what happened to our property. I would say that it was probably a once off occurrence but surprised they did not do more for us.
174,Nothing included in room cost. It was expensive so a breakfast or something would have been a nice touch.
175,"They charge you additional 35 dollars for wi fi service, which I believe should be free in grand hotel like this one."
176,"- Staff was absolutely rude and ungracious. 
- No water in the room...each bottle would be charged @$20 including delivery charge to the room.
- Spoon for medicine to be charged @$7 plus tax...we ordered a desert instead.
- Room was not cleaned properly for 2 days out of 3. We actually complained to the Housekeeping but still no one came to help. Requested access to house keeing manager, which went unheard. 
Overall nothing positive to write about.
Instead we spent the next 3 nights at Encore Wynn and had an absolute amazing time...Highly recommend all travellers to check Wynn Encore as it is the right property for luxury travellers at similar pricing but amazing value for money."
177,"Front desk/reception was often very busy, but such is the case with most hotels in Vegas."
178,The fridge was a vending machine so no mini fridge to cool some drinks.
179,"Nothing, other than the systems being down which isn't anyone's fault"
180,The front desk staff didn't look like they were having a very good day and the lady that was helping me talked to me as if she didn't really care and just wanted to give me the room quickly and moved onto the next person.
181,It could have been a lot more modern. It looks late 80's done up a little. You can see by the wear and tear in areas in the room. Also walking through a complete smoking floor of a casino to get to your room elevator isn't the best experience with kids. Needs to be a separate area for this.
182,"Weak water pressure, didn't feel like a 5 star hotel. The beds were worn down and in need of change. They don't even provide slippers or water. Their robes were worn down and felt like rags. They charge $6 for a bottle of water. The wifi is really slow and to put it nice and short"
183, not worth the price of the room.
184,"The place is so big, so it was difficult and sometimes takes a long time to get from one place to another."
185,"The staff were very rude, unprofessional and unwelcoming. There was no coffee provided in the room."
186,The ventilation in the casino. It was really smokey but never did it effect our room or stay.
187,"Always difficult to unlock the door from my room, even the keys have changed. And a front desk staff has said that she gonna send someone to check the lock of the door but nobody gonna come to check on it."
188,"Smoking in the casino, you have to smell the smoke when you pass to the elevators. Would be nice to have normal breakfast. 45 minutes waiting time for the luggage take out."
189,Originally we were in a room on the 27th floor but as we asked for a room with a view we paid an up charge of approx $150 to get a view of the Las Vegas strip but received a room on the 8th floor with No view at all.
190,"They charge extra for all, all the water in the room are $5.00 and up!, don't open the mini-bar they will charge only for opening the door"
191,"The hotel may have been affordable, but food & drinks can be quite expensive, Within the hotel, and on the strip! For example a small water bottle that was located in the rooms mini bar was $7..."
192,Expensive! The casino is pricey with huge table minimums and the restaurants are pricey too although some have great happy hours. Ended up with 35 dollars in bogus mini bar charges although they were removed on check out with no problems. Wifi was rubbish. Took a big reservation of money from my credit card and still waiting for the refund 6 days later!
193,"- For a luxury hotel, there no slippers, toothbrush and toothpaste provider- Disconnect service between housekeeping & room service. We ordered food from the in-room dinning the night before however we were shocked to learned that the housekeeping didn't collect the plates when they cleaned up our room the following day. Upon calling, we were told to call room service instead. We called room services however no one came. The plates were left in our room for 2 days before they were collected =("
194,Pls read above.
195,"There wasn't a kettle in my room for tea or coffee. I had to order a carafe for $16.00, plus extra fees totaling to $30 for a carafe of coffee. The coffee itself was terrible. It was bitter and not even luke warm."
196,A bit far from the things/places that I was doing in the strip.. But it was only for my experience. Easy to get taxi or uber anyway.
197,No tea or coffee in the room.
198,Nothing made me uncomfortable or sad everything was perfect for me
199,At check in the front desk agent was a little snobby. I wish I had a warm welcoming since it was my first time at the hotel. She seemed to be doing the bare minimum when checking me in and I know I was early when checking into my room but when I asked if I could get something a bit higher she got frustrated with me saying that it was still early and I would have to wait and she wasn't able to give me a time. I know the process of checking someone in and I don't blame her answers but the attitude could have been skipped.
200,A later check out is always a plus.
201,The system was down due to an upgrade and they couldn't let us get the room right away on check in time. Later they gave us a room and then told us they need to move us to another room which was different to what we asked for which then they needed to move us to a third room but it was already 11 pm and wanted to sleep so we slept in the second room. It was a big mess!!
202,Took 7 hours to get my room and they tried to give me a 100 food voucher to be used in the hotel... wow.. then got to my room finally and found out it was the wrong room.. the pricing in the hotel was crazy... spent 70 for a breakfast and they charge you almost 4.00 for a pop..
203,Not being able to store even a bottle of water in the fridge supplied as it was completely full of stocked items.
204,"The wifi signal was very poor in our room, it would only work if you were sitting right at the desk in the corner. We contacted the hotels IT department and the problem still persisted. In the end I gave up trying to connect. There was also no bar fridge to put any items. The items in the small fridge was stocked full of mini bar item (which if you lifted or moved anything would be charged to your bill). I also didn't appreciate the strong cigarette smell in the halls. I understand that it's a casino and people smoke in the lobby etc but the smell lingered in the hall outside our door. Wasn't plesent to smell all the time. I also thought to gondola ride looked amazing but I feel like hotel guests shouldn't have to pay the full price , or at least a discount for hotel guests."
205,The room service was very pricey- especially with delivery fees on top.
206,"With all the awesome things they had to offer, they were some downers as well. First, my husband opted to receive the 15 dollars of ""table "" credit instead of ""slot"" credit. However, the tables wouldn't accept the credit so we were left with essentially a souvenir check. Also, some of the staff are just down right rude. Although we stayed for 4 days, we only ate breakfast there only once. The breakfast staff were just ridiculously rude. Not to mention I absolutely hated having to go downstairs because, as soon as you step off of the elevator you are attacked by the smell of smoke."
207,The only thing I had an issue with was having to walk through the smokey casino floor with my children to get to the rooms
208,"Terrible services:a) long check-in line and rude / unfriendly staff. Booked into the Venetian, but got Palazzo (sister property attached to the Venetian)... no idea why?b) SHOCKING house keeping - not enough amenities (e.g. towels, shampoo, etc) provided for the number of people booked and paid for in the room. One day our room wasn't even cleaned - had to be requested a number of times and was only cleaned at 8pm that evening. Any requests took c.2 hours to be actioned. No turndown services - for a high * hotel, very unexpected!c)Terrible concierge service - rude, unfriendly, not interested staff, only happy to sell their own 'approved' services. d) Absolutely no help with luggage on check in or check out - prepare to drag your luggage yourself to your rooms through carpeted casino floors!!!Very disappointed stay will not return."
209,"The hotel is beautiful.  However, it didn't feel clean.  The non-smoking room had the fragrance of cigarette smoke.  The room was dark and had a not so fresh odor to it.  We normally putts on the day of check out to enjoy our stay"
210," this time, we were up at 6AM and out by 8AM."
211,Wish they had a fridge to store our own personal drinks and food.
212,"There is a charge of 25 dollars a day to ""rent"" a fridge. The one included in the room is packed full of purchasable items with no room left for your own food or drinks. The amenities of the room were extremely lacking for the price that we payed to stay. No hair dryer, no coffee maker, no extra towels"
213,only two full sized ones left for us! It was a beautiful room but lacked in the comforts that even cheap hotels our iced for no extra cost. Very disappointed in that aspect
214,The shower jet power was really poor. There is nothing to do there but the casino and the mall. So boring and limited You end up being charged away more that what you agreed to pay upon check in. Overall poor value for money
215,I booked on the Venetian but the room was at the Palazzo Hotel maybe they are the same but they should mention this at the booking because at the website they are separate.
216,Cigarette smoke thru casino!
217,We are older and did not like the difficult  maze and distance we had to navigate to find our room. I also did not like the heavy quilt on the bed. I sweat all night. Thought I had the air set cold enough. I need a lighter blanket
218,"Cleaning of our suite wasn't thorough, and dirty drinking glasses were not replaced during a whole week."
219,"I didn't like that I checked into venetian hotel but yet they put me into palazzo which I had walk across whole property to get to my suite.And that's not all I valet park my car when I checked in, so when I was checking out I was fine to check out at palazzo but yet again I had walk across property to get my car from venetian valet staff, which I was not advised from registration staff when I arrived or when I checked out."
220,Very noisy by our room. Stayed at a different hotel on the strip and it was closer to the airport but the room was alot quieter.
221,"There was a large blood stain under our pillow, which we didn't notice until the morning after since we didn't get into bed until very late the previous night. It left us feeling grossed out. We were offered a room change but since we booked our stay next to our family, we didn't want to relocate."
222,"everything is with fees even water and hot water ,kettle etc. it doesn't sound good with this luxury designed hotel. in gulf area where I live we used to luxury service although paid indirectly but give nice impression water free , kettle ....."
223,"what I don't like of this super expensive hotels is that you don't have free wifi or coffee or water in the room!! In cheap motels you always have those services, I don't understand why they don't offer this in the expensive ones, that should be basic"
224,"Heated pool, hot tub, jacuzzi would've been great. A refrigerator to hold our left overs and drinks would've been nice without an extra charge."
225,The room had hard water spots and stains on the counter tops.  The TV kept losing signal and freezing up.  The toilet and sink kept running and had a smell coming from the water.  It took 4 hours to get a package delivered from the internal package room AND 3 hours to get dishes cleared from room service.  Carpet was shabby in the room I was in
226,"I kind of wished the shower had a closed door/curtain, but it wasn't a huge deal. Also   a mini fridge and microwave would have been nice."
227,"As a Brit, I missed having tea and coffee making facilities and would have loved to have had breakfast included."
228,The fact that the rooms didn't have coffee making facilities.
229,A shame not to have breakfast/ water/ any food or drink included
230,"No morning paper outside doior,  shower didn't have good water pressure,communication was not always forthcoming,"
231,Our view was a little boring. Having a pay minibar in such a place seems a bit silly. The prices were prohibitive.
232,There's nothing to dislike about the hotel.
233,Looking old and the towel in toilet are dirty and the value of money 40% more than showing in Booking.com The hotel will till you to pay 40% more in check in!!!!!!!!
234,I did not like having to cut through the smoky casino to check in and check out. I also missed a coffee maker.
235,"Casino felt taken advantage of, as someone who had not played black jack before."
236,Unfortunately when we checked into the Venetian they didn't have a non smoking room available therefore they put us up in the Palazzo. The Palazzo is also fantastic but we did book to stay at the Venetian.
237,Vegas in general is getting very pricey.
238,the bar in the casino was dirty and messy 
239,"the video poker machines buttons were sticky, needed cleaning up"
240,"Housekeeping could have been much better. The shampoos, soaps, bathrobes and glasses were not replenished. The Wifi was good in casino, however it was PATHETIC in the room."
241,"The beds were too high to climb into without a stool. We were given a room at the far end of the hallway and told it was halfway down the hall, (which it wasn't) so it  meant we had to walk the furthest to and from the elevators, even though we both use walkers. This made it difficult to go anywhere and we got tired before we even got started. It would have been nice to have seen a floor map when checking in to help find the ice machine and see where our room would be before we accepted it and went all that way."
242,The rooms do not have tea / coffee making facilities. Only plastic cutlery available in the food court.
243,"The service of the staff was terrible, they wanted a lot of money for everything and werr really sarcaatic and non caring.. for examply they dont provide a toothbrush and if u want one simple one they only offer a crappy kit for 32 dollars.. worst hotel iv'e ever been in vegas.. me and my friend checked out after one day and decided to go to the aria"
244,"After having stayed in the Aria for a similar amount of money, we couldn't have been more disappointed. The reception area is loud and overcrowded with nowhere to sit if the queue is long, or if you're in a big party and some want to wait at the chairs. I was feeling very ill when we arrived, and there was nowhere for me to wait while my boyfriend checked in. The design of the place actually feels kinda oppressive, low ceiling, lots of smoke, and too many people made it feel like an overcrowded zoo."
245,The casino was not clean and air filtration was not sufficient. Ash trays were left dirty and I found in several locations. The door key pad to room had to be fixed in the middle of the night.
246,"Personel in reception are not friendly,gave me very far room from the left inspite I am 60 years old, no meal plan, although the room is expensive no kettle, when I asked for one they charge me for it??, on checkin they took 100$in cash and gave me receipt to take it back on checkout,but they did not give me the money as promised and told me they will return it to my credit card"
247,Was fully booked when I needed it:)
248,must of the stuff are not nice. the minibar is full so you dont have any place to put anything refrigerated
249,"Although we paid with 3 months in advance using booking, the room was not confirmed, and we have problems at checking, not having the exact room we had requested. At the end they ""found"" one."
250,"Not the best and kindest staff, no sun in the swimming pool areas, rooms far away from the elevators, dealers with no smile on their face. I will certainly not come back again."
251,I cannot think of anything I didn't like about the place besides the check in issue
252,"1. The bedsheets had a foul odor, and the corridors had a horrible stench2. Everything took over 40 mins to come ( water, in room slippers, luggage, bell boy , food, and even tissues.) 3. We changed rooms after the first night and we had to wait over 2 hours just to get our keys and everytime we called reception they said it was on the way to us. 4. We were charged for everything and anything , and though i dont mind paying, in return i would have liked to see the amount of money going into the hotel being reciprocated through the service and quality like any 5 star hotel.5. We have been to numerous 5 star hotels , this was by far, the worst experience . We were not treated like how a 5 star hotel should treat it's hotel guests.6. This is the most commercial and profit based hotel i have been to , the quality and service was the lowest i've ever experienced.(Bear in mind we stayed in a deluxe suite and we are IHG elite members and we were treated as if we were in some 3 star hotel) * we are newlyweds and since we are IHG elite members they upgraded us to another room which was exactly the same size and it was a DOUBLE bed room ???"
253,there was still hairs of the previous customer in the bathtub.  Internet going up and down
254,"First off, I booked online and the price shown on website was totally different when checking in. I would recommend to just include all tax and resort fee so customers are aware of what to expect. Its shocking really, especially if the price difference is a large amount."
255,It's a pretty big property and I managed to get lost a few times.
256,"Hotel information lacked in the hotel room e.g. No clear literature on the services available E.g. Pool times, shopping, dining, entertainment, bars, gaming etc. Not even when & where. The experience was more biased towards self discovery on that front."
257,there is nothing included at the price. as a guest of the hotel - you do not get any privileges - no breakfast etc.  the pool was too small
258,"It was a lot of trouble checking in and finding a place suitable for a group with a 1 yr old baby. After two trips to reception and a phone call...p.s two trips in a very large hotel meant 1 hr process with a 1yr old baby...... checking in seeing the rooms and finding out they were initially very very far from eachother, calling reception, heading back down, talking to someone nice enough to give us two adjoining rooms, moving our stuff again. Casino - smoking...but I guess this is allowed in Las Vegas.... We managed to find routes around the smoke.We mainly stayed here to be close to the canyon and to be comfy. Worth it, but the hotel is so huge, having a problem at check in makes it a large mess. So make sure to spend the extra time down there, and cross your fingers you have a nice staff member so they can accommodate a travelling family with a 1yr old."
259,Nothing.  I enjoyed everything.
260,I disliked the long walk to the elevators to get to your rooms......it didn't matter which way you enter. I also dislike having to walk through smokey areas which is very popular in Vegas
261,The rooms for me were a disappointment. They were not of 5 star quality and there wasn't even water or a tea/coffee maker which is standard in most hotels in America. You had to pay a resort fee to use the facilities and the restaurant and bar prices were so high. It felt like you had to pay for an extras that in a 5 star hotel should have been included. The pool chairs were filthy as well.
262,"The resort is so large that it took us 10+ minutes to get from our hotel room, down two sets of elevators and across breezeways, etc to get to food court/restaurants/gym. It got old very fast. The staff is positioned at various stations along trek to point you in the right direction which we appreciated. I would definitely request a room closer to the hub of activity next time."
263,If you want a strip view you'll have to pay extra other than that nothing to complain about!
264,No coffee maker in the room . Close from another person left behind still there .  Sofa bed dirty with stuff on it .
265,"The most disgusting hotel room ever. 
The housekeeping service is really bad. 
Some of the things i was shocked to see in a 5 star hotel. ( i was served dinner in a broken tray! , the duvet was torn! And one of the days i left the room at 1pm and came back at 9pm and it wasn't clean.  Really the worst experience ever."
266,"Housekeeping left dirty dishes in the room. Didn't clean shower area. A housekeeping manager stopped by the room and told us that he would make it better "" for the next guests"" and walked away without taking the dirty dishes out of our hands!"
267,"- No simple things as kettles in the room- Encountered an issue that required remote assistance by phone (after checkout), staff wasn't helpful on this case- Pool seating options isn't big enough for this amount of visitors- Irritating minibar that charge for everything you *moving* in the bar + doesn't allow to put your own bottle of water."
268,"The shower head was a trickle, terrible water pressure. The towels were threadbare. Just seems a bit tired and starting to need a refresh - especially considering the price. There are way better options these days than the Venetian - it used to be my favourite, but no more!"
269,"Mandatory resort fee added on top of room cost, even though we didn't use the facilities. By the time we added this, tax, and paid for breakfast which wasn't included the night cost over £200."
270,Trek from self parking to reception and another to the room.
271,"When we arrived , in our rental care we were sent around the world to park. Really stressful after a very long trip. Staff didn't seem to know where we should go.
Long check in queue. When I went down to the lobby an hour later there was still a long queue."
272,Cost and up-charge to check in 2 hours early when obviously rooms are available. And resort fee that I had no intention of using.
273,a five star hotel should have a coffee maker in the room. it is a loooong walk to get a cup of coffee in the morning.
274,The hotel is a bit aged and stinks like cigarettes!!!! They charge you for a kettle and don't provide complimentary tea and coffee in the room!!! They charge you if you knock something in the mini bar (as its weight sensitive) even if you don't use it!! Brutal!! You are definitely just a number at this huge hotel!! We also found the gambling here very expensive!!! There were no options to bet smaller amounts.
275,I would say the worst part was how difficult it is to figure out how to work around the hotel.  It took us 30 minutes and poor directions just to find the gondola ride. it was super frustrating.
276,We didn't find out until our last morning that we could have gotten discounts in at least the cafe express for being a hotel guest. Where else not sure. 1 casino employee was very rude. I say bring comfortable walking shoes. Our feet hurt the whole time. We walked too much with the wrong shoes
277, our fault 😏 When leaving the guys were very helpful at customer service at Palazzo but the airport shuttle never showed! That is the reason and the rude employee for the low score.
278,Time and effort required to get to and from the room using two elevators and six corridors. No usable fridge in the room. No coffee making facilities.
279,"The hotel is sooooo large, it is hard to find your room, restaurants, shops.More signage would be appreciated."
280,"Smoking everywhere, but it is come with Las Vegas package. Did not have a coffee machine in the room. But on the positive side of it: it made us have coffee by the Venecian canal."
281,Time it took to check inTime it took to obtain a rewards cardLack of a coffee machine in roomThe resort freeElevators were not all operating
282,Casino waitresses could have been more friendly. The dealers were fine but the waitresses were often curt and dismissive.
283,There's no such a thing
284,-towels did smelt like food or some other smell but were clean.-rooms are lacking a hair dryer? couldnt find one.-for this amount of guest there are not enough sunbeds. If you want to go to the pool-get there early. Not shaded sunbeds are in minimum. People save sunbeds with towels and will come back hours later.
285,"The Hike to our room.  Not only was it like going through a maze but being one who has health issues and a difficult time walking long distances we probably walked at least a good quarter of a mile if not more to get to our room.  I had requested a low floor and something close to an elevator or entrance so I wouldn't have to walk to far.  I hav wanted to stay at the Venetian for quite awhile but was disappointed that it was such trouble to get to our room.  Also, we were hoping to do a Gondola ride for our anniversary but the prices were outrageous.  Truly the only good thing about the stay was the staff"
286,"I'm not a Vegas person so...Most irritating was their extre 35$ for the hotel facilities, even though we never used them. The total price with taxes was 200$!The smokes of cigarettes was felt all the way up to the corridor You must go throw all the stupid machine to get to the elivator that will take you to your room"
287,"My stay at the Venetian Hotel was not much of a great one. I was upgrade room I paid $100 each day  Front desk staff said that room great street view but it was swimming pool view and wifi didn't work Also,  The sink in the bathroom did not close all the way. It kept leaking of water as well as the shower knobs. The constant running of water was of insanity. The water kept the floors of the bathroom moist like a swimming pool changing room. This was definitely not one of a satisfying stay.."
288,"Just wish they had firm foam pillows. We called housekeeping and thought they were bringing some to our room, but it was just two more feather pillows. That's the only complaint"
289,Prices in the stock mini bar an fridge!
290,"NO coffee pot in room. While, I understand there are coffee shops and room service, very cheap of them not to provide a convenience for their guests. NO free airport shuttle! What??? Another important amenity that was missing.  Even the Gondola ride had to be paid for!!!"
291,Really Expensive
292,"Hotel room should provide coffee maker or microwave. Fridge is full of hotel items, no space to store our own drink. Not suitable for family that need hot water or to store milk."
293,Our room wasn't cleaned every day.Wifi was terrible.Costs such as spa costs were very expensive.
294,"The service is real bad, it took forever for the staff to bring one thing to the room, even though it was something basic which it should be in the room before the guest check in, such as flippers and toothbrushes. Very disappointed at the services and will never go back."
295,"Its just too big.. Staff is inconsistent.. Some sre great some are shockers.. We were told we had $150 room credt per for each of our two rooms on check in only to find out that it was only for one room, mean while we had already spent our credit for each room .."
296,Could have had a coffee machine in the room
297,The check-in queue was very long when we arrived. It appeared every day is like so. The front desk staff is lack of energy and doesn't seem to be patient.
298,only one thing could have been better. If I had more time to stay
299,"Valet was a bit rude to our son, as he apparently pulled into the wrong lane - he wanted us to drive completely around in ridiculous traffic and get into the correct lane. So from then on we self parked."
300,"I ordered eggs benedict Saturday morning. Shortly after I became ill and vomited. (I haven't drank alcohol in 8 years so it was attributed to anything to do with alcohol). I haven't vomited from food in 20 years, so it was directly related to the breakfast.I was fine after about 30 mins. That meal, I would to like have compensated. But once again,  everything else was 5 STAR !!"
301,The noise in the restaurant during breakfast was far to loud.  I assume it was that to drown out the noise from the slot machines.
302,"Found a couple of business cards in the robe pocket, which suggests that the robes had been used by previous guest. Put them to wash immediatley but got new ones right away. Under the beds could be a little more cleaner..."
303,"the pool was a disappointment. We found it quite small and not so creative and fun.  They have quite a few pools, but they are all the same, only differ in size."
304,"The room is old and not well maintained, many power plugs are loose. No breakfast, drinking water, heater at this price. And it is very far away between parking, front deck and your room.
The canal view is not attractive to us in compare with the music fountain in Bellegio."
305,"long trek from anywhere to our suites, up to three elevators and hallway trips long enough to carry a lunch, the logistics of this place is very confusing. We had eleven people in our group and we all agreed never again. A beautiful place very impressed. The food was not impressive,and thats an understatement."
306,Service at the grand lux was poor also this is second year in a row that we have tried to order French toast to find that there is none available. Items on menu should be available.
307,Check in queue was long but well managed.  Signage for entrance and exit from the car park was non-existent.  I got completely lost trying to get back out on to the strip to drive back to the airport.
308,The hotel is massive so takes ages to get in/out of the hotel or to places in the hotel it's self.There was no coffee/tea making facilities (or complimentary water) in the rooms & as its so far away from cafes...Needed a map of hotel as its difficult to find your way around
309,"Restaurants were slightly pricey but it's the Venetian in Vegas, easy to find slightly less pricey places!"
310,"We paid for a view of the strip which i don't believe we got. The only hotel on the strip we could see was the Mirage over the road, hardly a strip view."
311,Nothing I have stayed in several hotels in Vegas but this hotel by far was the best and the cost was less then the service I received.
312,Smoke near or in casino. Lack of adequate staffing at concierge desk. long wait on phone. The pool closed to early at 10pm. It should of been open until midnight.
313,"IT guy tried to charge me $170 to make HDMI work, fixed it myself for free later.
Extremely large hotel with bad directions to some places in the hotel, easy to get lost."
314,I stayed for three days no body come to clean my roomThe smoking in the entranceAlthough they said its non smoking hotel
315,Service in the restaurants was slow.
316,It smells like tobacco in several places since you can smoke inside. A bit pricey in general but not as pricey as other hotels. TV check out didn't work.
317,"Everything is seriously overpriced as everywhere in Vegas and the smell of smoke hangs in the air. By now, you can get better service and amenities in any mid class Hotel in China..."
318,"Light in our room was on constantly as the switch to turn it off didn't work - very annoying when trying to sleep. The floor got soaked when using the shower as the door seal wasn't on all the way down. 
Didn't ruin our stay though and I would defiantly book it again."
319,"A little pricey, given that breakfast is not included. Also, when you pay on booking, be aware that they also charge you a service fee of around 30 $ per day, plus other tax."
320,"No real welcome on arrival, ignored by bell boys and check-in staff very robotic. Room service well overpriced and sub-standard for the strip. Quite smoky in casino, newer hotels much better air quality."
321,"No coffee facilities in the suite, sounds pathetic but when you pay nearly $300 and then have to go downstairs and pay another $8-10 for your morning coffee it a little annoying!!! Also there is a minibar but no separate fridge for keeping your drinks cool. Not big issues but for the price it's disappointing"
322,"Would have liked a Cleaner bedroom, very dusty, no coffee machine in room, Very busy lobby at all times"
323,Nothing. This place gets a 10/10
324,"The key to the room didn't work probably, remote control was broken and after the cleaning the tub was dirty"
325,"It looks very luxury as appearance, but I don't think it is reaching professionism as a hotel in term of service. We paid USD400 a night, only for the look not feel real from the heart."
326,Would have preferred a room with a view of the strip rather than the back of the hotel.
327,Beds aren't very comfortable. No activities like water volley ball going on in the pool areas. The hotel is smoker friendly which reminded me of being in an old snooker hall before the ban. Everything in the shops and restaurants is quite expensive so we went else where after a couple of nights.
328,"View from our room sucked! It was the top of the outside of the convention center. I think they should have offered us a better room, with a view. I think they put us on the hospitality floor which was much too noisy for my taste."
329,"Very disappointed, reported on night one that there was a strong smell of cannabis coming into our room from the corridor, was told it is totally unacceptable and security would deal with it..the problem just got worse, every hour the smell kept coming in to our room for the next 2 nights! 
Wifi was absolutely terrible, got the top tier package and was no improvement whatsoever. 
This hotel is stunning, but over priced for the experience. What do we pay our resort fees for??
Very little atmosphere for such a highly renowned hotel."
330,"Service and staff, very poor services. Second night in my wife lost her key and they wouldnt allow her in and they refuse to contact me, till i got there a few  hours later, no apolagies, she was mistreated, wont recommend this place to my worst enemy. Avoid this place."
331,nothing ...it's utterly beautiful !!!
332,Hotel had no atmosphere. Was very expensive to stay in and facilities weren't excellent and were overpriced to use (not all facilities included in room price). We were celebrating a special occasion which staff where aware of but no acknowledgement made
333,The hotels water bottle in the rooms are not complementary they cost $5.It would have been nice if they were complementary as you are paying so much money to stay in the hotel.
334,"On check in we upgraded to a suite with a view, BUT the room hadn't been cleaned--bed unmade, trash in the room, used towels thrown all over the bathroom. Not what we expected from this hotel."
335,Very expensive to eat or drink in (like all the hotels in Vegas). But there are 2 Walgreens on either side of the hotel where you can buy much cheaper alcohol and snacks!
336,"The showers are large but are not particularly powerful, it won't blow away those cobwebs or bad hangovers. Some of the room furniture is a little well worn and not all that comfy. Not a negative but the huge scale of the place makes everything (even things in the hotel) quite far away from your room."
337,"When we checked-in there was a room key and sunglasses on the table like somebody had been there. So staff came and collected those items. Everything was cleaned but it did make us a bit bummed. Also, Pringles was charged to our room when we didn't have any but we got that removed from our bill without problem. Wi-fi was slow."
338,No tea or coffee facilities in the suite.  The tv in bathroom didn't work.
339,"The service is soso. When we check in got to the hotel room, both keys not working, the 3 day came back from the show, the room key not working, we called 4 times, the house keeper who was passing by told us she cannot open the door for us, after she was done, saw us still waiting, she called for us, then we see the engineer after more then 20 minutes waiting, he confirm the key is not working as we already knows."
340,The fact I had to walk for a while to reach the lift.. the property is so big that you always have to carry your flats with you.
341,"Smoking in the casino. The gusts in the outdoor park, poolarea. The park was closed one day."
342,Wi Fi has a good coverage throughout the surroundings but it has certification issues. I kept getting warnings about the certification and recommendations not to use the hotel Wi Fi.
343,"Ate in the grand lux cafe- found the service very poor, the waiter forgot to bring one of the starters.. Ordered the steaks medium, they were served rare, sent them back and they were returned rare again. Would not return to this restaurant."
344,"During weekends, there is a beach party by the main pool, this creates a horrible noise, there are other pools but this seems to be the only one that gets the sun!"
345,"Not great value for money. At $500 a night I don't want a view of all the aircon ducts. Felt dated inside too - freyed carpet, toilet door not closing properly - little things you expect to be perfect for that sort of money. Location is the big selling point."
346,Loosing bucks at the casino Grrr .
347,"Amount of miles put on the car while with the valet parking, shame about all the additional payment even though the price had been paid through booking.com"
348,"We were four woman sharing a sub-par hair dryer!  After traveling for 2 weeks prior to various other hotels, we were surprised the hair dryer at The Venetian was so low powered."
349,Nothing
350,"The worst staff I've ever dealt with. I literally waited for about half an hour for someone to pick up the phone to take my request. The hotel is way understaffed. It takes about 7 minutes to go from my room to the reception and then join the long queue there. This is why I waited with my luggage outside my room for 40 minutes as the key was not working after I checked in. These things do not mean that the staff were rude or anything like that. It just the fact that it's a complete mess.
I will never go back to this hotel again."
351,"Maid servicing of the rooms each day was very inconsistent despite tips being left everyday. Some days the place was left really clean, other days it was like no one had serviced the room."
352,Very little not to like with this property. It has everything there. You could spend 4 days there and not see everything
353,"Long line for check in, waited 20 minutes even at 1 am.  Paper coffee cups at Bouchon kiosk leaked. Coffee itself was excellent!  When we mentioned it, they gave us our coffee free and double-cupped it.  The casino floor is loud and smoky smelling (although they do an admirable job of filtering the smoke out, it's not smoky looking).  By the time we'd left we had figured out how to exit the hotel without having to pass through the casino."
354,I would like it if there were hard pillow available in the room!
355,That you have to pay the high resort fee even though you don't use any other facility than your room. We knew it would be like that but it doesn't make it better.
356,"i ordered a cake and some other gifts for my sisters birthday two days before arrival and was going to have them delivered to the room for 1pm on day, however, when we came back to room singing happy birthday the room was empty.  We looked like idiots..  I went down to concierge and they had the cake sent up right away, and the gifts came to the room at 5pm.  So, the surprise was ruined and i still had to leave the room to coordinate the times when i had done it two days in advance already.  Very annoying, floral sent up an extra cheese basket but it still ruined the surprise and took my time away from my party for an hour to go deal with it.  I was trying to avoid that, to make it seem that much more special.  It was annoying at the least.  Also, there is way to much smoking in the venetian, it was disgusting to walk around in plumes of smoke."
357,need a map to get around its just so big got lost a lot (not a bad thing though)
358,Gondalas were quite pricey.
359,The difficulty to speak to someone at the front desk from the room phone.
360,they are pushing u to buy  for good view room .if u didnt do ..they r giving very bad room without nothing to see..they havent intersting w u ..r u ok or all is ok ..etcto much expensive for that kind of service.cleaner people was very kind and helpfull.other staff was not kind and no smile..pool bar staff was not kind.they r working in there very agresive and dont wanna do their job.that hotel has to educate their staff emergency.
361,"We did not appreciate being charged $48 for refreshments in our room we did not use. Said amount was returned, however, once we called them, without any particular fuss."
362,"Its a very busy hotel/casino/convention center with 7000 guest rooms!The booking.com price did not include the compulsory 'resort fee' $35 nor the city tax $50 odd so theres an extra $85 a night extra you dont expect.  Like so much in Vegas, it's a money making machine.   Restaurants, Cafes etc are all wildly overpriced (+ don't forget the 20-25% tips!). Finding your way around the hotel is difficult as they make sure you have to walk through the Casino to get to your room!Although it looks like a 5* hotel a lot of detail is missing in order to cut costs.  Towels are tired, table tops scratched, soaps are cheap etc etc (I suspect they use a lot of produce from their Macao/Chinese location)."
363,"Hate the additional $32 per night resort fees which include items such as wifi, gym use and boarding pass pringreat ting,  all of which should be included in the room rate. Rip off."
364,Extra blankets and towels didn't come with the room by default and were a little hard to obtain. The in-room phones didn't work.
365,No coffee facility in room and a 500 yard walk to pick up the free coffee every morning
366,The check-in starts at 3pm but that doesn't mean that the room will be ready by then. Cleaning staff has up to 5pm to prepare rooms which means that you could have to wait. Very frustrating for a hotel of that category / price.
367,"Nothing really. Maybe the fact we easily got lost a few times in the hotel but it is like that in all the Vegas hotels. There was nothing we didn't like about the hotel itself. Had the best time here, just wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the pools more."
368,Nothing! This hotel was perfect!
369,Nothing!
370,The resort fees were more expensive than was stated by Booking.com when I made the booking.Outside Gondola ride is poor value for money
371,"Room had no soap and when we asked for some the maid all but accused us of stealing it.  Also, I never received the promised checkout confirmation."
372,No one to help with luggage at the main doors.Did not appreciate the persistence of the cosmetic sellers.
373,You had to walk through the gaming/casino area to get to the rooms. There was no dedicated hotel breakfast area. The lobby felt like a train station.
374,"The room keys did not work on two occasions, so we had to go the long way back to the reception to Fix it.The pool area was very crowded, and there were no sun umbrellas available. Also, the pool beds were crammed together so that you were sitting 5cm from a total stranger.They had pressure sensors in the mini bar which meant we could not use the mini bar to store any of our drinks.It's a long walk from your room to the reception, parking, the strip etc. Not very convinient."
375,Paid quite a bit for wi fi which wasn't very good and didn't work from the bed so couldn't watch netflix in bed.
376,"Lack of sun loungers due to other guest leaving towels on loungers once they had left, or guests hogging the loungers for hours leaving a top for example on them. This resulted in many people not gettin a sun lounger or groups having to split up. This isn't the fault of the hotel, but they could look to manage this selfish behavior."
377,"This is far from a 5 star hotel, much more in the 4 star bracket compared to European standards. no evening TD service, no luggage porters, no rooming. the hotel of course is also massive, so expect to walk for an hour to get to your room!"
378,"Service to the rooms was relatively slow/non existent in some cases? Stood in line at midnight for 45 minute to check in after a long day of travel. In another instance we asked from an extra blanket, told we could expect it in 20-30mins and never received anything. Maybe not enough staff to handle the Labor Day weekend?"
379,That there was no fridge space for personal use or tea making facilities.
380,"I will not be staying at this hotel again due to their customer service. I had issues with  booking this hotel and them not wanting to help me once my reservations were cancelled....if it was not for booking.com that helped me i would have stayed somewhere else but trust and believe i will not be giving my money to the venetian EVER AGAIN. Also one of the customer service reps at the front desk name Jessica was really rude and just nasty, and not to me but other customers as well. They also charged me an extra $7-8 when i was only suppose to pay what was stated when i booked this through booking.com"
381,No tea and coffee making facilities in the room. No fridge for us to put our own drinks in - only a mini bar which charged as soon as an item was removed.   No water left in the room for teeth brushing etc.Gondola rides were pretty pricey for a family of 4.
382,The cleanliness.
383,"The main pool was overwhelmed by party people, but there was a smaller pool area which was calmer except for all the families.  The resort fee is now up to $35.84 a day.  You do get free Wifi and access to Canyon Ranch Spa.  May want to opt out if neither a high priority."
384,"Room dark and needs more lighting. Also when you book a suite, a small refrigerator should be included at no charge.Thought the spa prices were ridiculous"
385,"The Venetian and The Palazzo are from the same company, we booked with The Venetian but they sent us to The Palazzo for some reason."
386,"The place is too big. There are actually 3 different hotels inside (Venetian, Venezia an Palazzo) which makes the walking really long and everytime you need to reach a restaurant or something, it takes 15min or more.The pool service stopped at 6pm in some pools... Also in other places the pool area is greener and ""cooler"""
387,There was nothing I didn't like at all.
388,"Beer at casino was a little pricey  at $8 a bottle, but everything else was wonderful."
389,No coffee/ tea making facilities in room. Whilst bathrooms and bed linens were well cleaned no one cleaned down table tops in the bedroom and they were very dusty after our 5 night stay. Bottled water in room way too expensive.
390,"House keeping lady woke us up at 8:00 am in the morning. She opened the door with her own key. Don't forget to put the ""do not disturb"" tag outside if you don't want any house keeping service before 10:00 am."
391,No breakfast buffet in morning.
392,"Cold and faceless monster hotel. All about the volume, not the quality. You have a feeling of being processed rather than looked after. Staff are nice overall but a bit jaded - like the hotel. Long queues to check-in are a pain. And there's a number of large dollar hidden charges like the resort fee which with other taxes added I think 30% to the already expensive price. Which isn't the best welcome off a long haul flight. Good quality is average, mostly processed for speed and volume."
393,"Very large hotel/resort, which can be bewildering to find one's way around."
394,"Most of the pools were closed. Loud music at the only open family pool. Drunk teenagers mixed with my kids, bad idea. I love a good party, but this was ridiculous. Make sure you have a family friendly pool! We actually checked out a day early because we could not even go to the pool normally :("
395,Our room did not come with a price list for the mini bar nor any type of hotel guide. The couch in the sitting area was uncomfortable to sit in. The ice buckets were really just too small.
396,Bathroom was a little dirty... Grout in tiles was grimey and the mirrors were dirty.
397,"Check in was very lack luster compared to other 5 star hotels in Vegas.  We did not feel welcomed.  The internet was terrible and since we needed it for work, my husband complained about the quality only to be told the ""included"" internet could be upgraded for a fee.We wanted a quick breakfast one morning and didn't want to wait in the huge lines at the restaurants so went to the ""fast food"" section for a breakfast.  It was horrible, toast wasn't buttered or offered, hash browns were raw.  The pools were very packed due to summer and not enough staff on to accommodate service."
398,"Very big hotel, so lots of walking from the main entrance to the room via two lifts.Confusing layout of property especially for first time guest. Little bit longer distance to get to amenities."
399,"When we checked-in, the rooms that we ordered were not available, although we ordered them months ago (we are a family of 5).The staff tried to make us take inferior rooms without telling the truth about them (for example: a queen bed instead of a king bed, or a high accessibility room, that doesn't have doors to the rest room) and eventually put us in their sister hotel, the Palazzo (the rooms are identical but the hotel is smaller and less fancy). One of the kids slept on the opened sofa instead of a queen bed as we ordered."
400,Paid extra for a view and wasn't that great .
401,"easy to loose your bearings, took us nearly an hour to find our room after going out onto the Las Vegas Strip"
402,"No coffee facilities in room. Smart plan not good value if you are not drinking in casino, free coffee  was long walk from room and limited online magazine access."
403,Staff specially the security team being rude and arrogant (definitely not expected from a 5 star hotel!)Not enough beds by the pools and that they close all pools but one or two during busy hours.
404,The fridge was not useable as it was full of Venetian items.  If you move one if those items the sensor records it and it is charged to your bill so no where to put your own drinks in summer heat.  Very user unfriendly and very annoying!
405,"Housekeeping very poor , No free water to drink in the Luxury Suite at least once ! No kettle so you can make a coffee!!"
406,I didn't like the fact I had no Tea and coffee complimentary  .and you tried to Charge me for a Mars I hadn't had ..$10 .
407,the size of the place easy to get lost
408,"Pool area and pool not great for familiesSo big, it feel very impersonalFelt more like a shopping center than hotel, but that's Vegas!"
409,"Booking.com didn't explain how the resort credit worked very well, they block £400 on your credit card. Which could have come in handy for shopping."
410,"Resort fee which covers local calls (not used) newspaper (not used) and wifi (this does not work adequately in the room but works sporadically in communal areas where free wifi is available anyway for occasional visitors) the hotel should do away with this resort fee and just add the cost onto the actual booking of the room. Nobody would complain as the hotel is beautiful. People will complain if the resort fee is charged for something that doesn't work!My only other complaint was at check in. I was made to feel cheap by refusing to pay extra for a room with s view of the strip. The staff members then explained that we would be given a key each as 'he' pointed to my room mate, may lose it! She then said what is his name anyway? thus was unprofessional and the reason why I didn't give the highest score for staff. Other than this all personnel were great."
411,I just hate thesmell of smoke when i pass the casno areas.
412,We couldn't get a space around any of the pools at 5pm... Shame as we were really looking forward to relaxing with a cocktail around the pool.
413,"This hotel is a cheap, trashy place, that feels as if you are in LAX airport. It is not a resort surely - they lack a quiet swimming pool area (no kids policy) or a quiet lobby area. There is not enough of daylight in the hotel or even in the outside pool areas. The outside pool areas are messy, crowded, look dirty. It is difficult to receive any information about hotel premises since the info leaflet is aimed to look fancy (yet super messy), concierge line is not available (loooong wait time) and the walk from your suite to concierge counter is also way tooo long. Same goes for in-room dining: wait time is 1hour. getting breakfast in that hotel should become an Olympic discipline, since it is a challenge (everything overcrowded with crazy wait time). Staff doesnt seem genuine. Hotel spa is an overkill - took me 30min to get my treatments scheduled cos the counter assistant was so slow and uninformed about the treatments."
414,"Very poor slow wi-fi (part of USD 30 resort fee), for better one was necessary to pay another USD 10. Minibar without possibility to put own drinks in. No leaflet or book with basic information about internet, TV, check-out, swimming pools etc."
415,The pool was big but not very clean. The drinks at the pool at was extremely expensive.
416,The walls/doors are thin I could hear people walking by my room
417,I will never book thru a 3rd party booking! It was my dgtrs 21st BD and we had MAJOR difficulty checking in even though I made the reservation a month in advance! The hotel also should be a little more transparent in their requirements like having to pay for the second night in person! NO WHERE did it tell me she would need a credit card or I would have been prepared. We are in another state and it was very stressful to have to deal with at least 3 different people while my daughter was in tears! Not good!
418,"I know it is lame to mention it but would be nice if there were slippers, I'm kinda of guy how collect hotels silppers as souvenir"
419,Nothing
420,Maybe they shoul renouvate some rooms
421,"Honestly this place was not worth the money that we had paid for. As a 5 star hotel I expected a lot more than rude, drunk, tawdry people roaming around in skimpy swimwear. The service was also not on par for a 5 star hotel, our room was not entirely clean(there were hairs in the shower drain) even when we first got in, the cleaning ladies didn't make much attempt to clean the next day either. Our door lock was completely faulty, the locks would take up to 20 attempts (no exaggeration, we'd cheer the one time that it took only 3 attempts) to finally work. They need to replace their locks! We visited the pools in the afternoon and with the amount of people in it you would think that it's a public pool. It's honestly best not to go into the pools, no amount of chlorine can kill all those diseases."
422,"Low down the strip, it's more lively towards the cosmopolitan and bellagio. Decor is a bit dated / old fashioned. Concierge was useless. No contacts for any club hosts, couldn't help organise any tours"
423," simply handing the odd leaflet.  Gave us free entry to Tao, the in hotel club, but that is a rubbish club."
424,"Issues at check in due to incorrect information provided by booking.com also $100 dollar deposit taken on arrival for extras which didn't mind standard practice but you weren't able to charge room service to your room? Reception staff we encountered were ""cold"" and uninterested."
425,The smell of smoke at the casinos ( and you can't avoid it since you have walk pass/ through the area to get to the elevators for the rooms)NO complementary coffee in the room! But a display of all sorts of snacks and drinks for absurd prices.
426,The one thing I missed the most was that we had no coffee and tea facilities but this is normal practice in most American hotels.
427,As it is such a big hotel it is easy to get lost or lose your bearings. Clearer signs would help avoid this!
428,Pool beds too close to one another lacking a bit of intimacy between groups
429,"Occupancy charge per night added $154 for our stay, hidden cost"
430,You can smoke in the casinos in Vegas/Nevada.  Not used to it anymore.  To get to another part of the hotel you often had to cross the casino - no easy/quick way around it and it's disgusting.  Too hot to take advantage of the pools in July/August - 105+ degrees at 6pm.
431,"More shade is absolutely needed around the pool areas.  It is a necessity if only to ensure the health of the many children we saw exposed to 100'F+ heat without the protection of shade.  Please, the wonderful Venetian, sort it out!!  Also please more signs to guest elevators/suites - we weren't the only ones  wandering around like lost souls!"
432,The long hallways.
433,Too expensive not worththe $ rude people next door theft etc... wont be staying here again and gondalos inside is a rip off.
434,Expensive to eat or drink unless you hunt around or go outside. Additional fee per room per night fee to cover wifi and gym etc which I think should be included in room price - and it does add up.
435,"The swimming pool rules, the life guards are not police! Blowing whistles every 2 minutes, we are not children... I'm it going to spill my drink in the pool, Closing the pool 4pm and cramming everyone into one pool is ridiculous, we are booked for another 2 days here but are checking out early to go to another hotel,with less pool rules"
436,The only thing I didn't care for was leaving a $100 deposit from my account on Wednesday and I still haven't been credited back my money. I didn't have any condiments to be charged to my room.
437,"overcharged. With booking.com they told me it was going to be 569€ plus 32 usd x2 for the resort fee plus then taxes of 9% or so (635€ approx) and in the end a total of 827€ were charged, i.e. about 200usd extra with no consumption at all."
438,Everything perfect.Venetian could be privileged with their own Hertz collection/ return bureau.
439,They don't have good shows like all the good artists play in ceasor palace .
440,The room didnt have a kettle to make tea
441,The hotel needs an renovation and should put up a higher dress code.
442,The car park was quite a walk.
443,I ordered room service once and think it gave my boyfriend food poisoning. I didn't eat any of it so I was fine but he was throwing up all night. We are both vegan and he ordered the hummus wrap which is one of the only vegan options for room service.
444,Room service food was terrible & way overpriced.  The order was incorrect.
445,The Pool area is really crowded and there are no places in the shade you even have to pay for them.  The Pools could be cleaner.
446,"Everything is so expensive!  The fully-stocked mini bar was so tempting but I didn't dare touch anything incase I inadvertently got charged - a weeny bottle of champagne was $39!  Noise around the pool from the Tao Beach Club was a bit off-putting at times.  My request for a decent view wasn't met, despite it being my 25th wedding anniversary - not unless I wanted to pay a whole heap more cash!  The only acknowledgement I got of our special occasion, was a typed letter on arrival saying someone could put together an itinerary for me if I so wished - very generous, I'm sure!  A bottle of wine or some flowers in the room, or a room with a view other than  over the aeroplane runway would have been a nice gesture!"
447,"Room service was terrible for a vegas hotel. Over an hour, arrived cold and was the wrong order..."
448,"Shower was okay, but would have liked a power shower. Didn't like having to pay 150 dollars per day for incidentals, none of which I used, as when this is refunded to your card you lose money on fees and exchange rates. However, upon check out this was really well dealt with by refunding me the resort fee as recompense, so very happy."
449,More like staying on a shopping mall than a 5 star hotel. Quite dated too & would have been nice to have breakfast included as standard.
450,"It's such a huge place, it's very confusing to find things & then you end up walking forever & possibly getting lost! Good floor/area maps needed."
451,Everything was good but the pools were dirty that i couldnt swim comfortably And the walk from the lobby to the room took us a good 10 mn walk plus 2 elevators to go to the second tower but thats not much of an issue because the hotel is soo big
452,Minor issues:The shower rose needed more holes as I didn't really feel like I got very wet.  Although I do understand that being in a desert water can be an issue. Some of the pools were closed until 3 even though there was a guard there and the other pool was quite crowded.
453,The casino had too many high tech machines. We are old school and I guess we haven't caught up with the times . Maybe a retro section would be helpful .
454,annoying wave music by the pools because the outdoor club is right there.  it really took away the relaxing mood that we were looking for
455,Despite staff trying you are a bit of a number. They can't hide that the hotel is huge.
456,There was no drinking water in the room neither kettle or complementary tea/coffee which is always now provided by 5* hotels
457,N/A
458,"That the distance from room to lobby is so long, you need to cross the casino, our room key didn't work so it was quit a trip to get a replacement."
459,"Bathroom robes had seen better days & needed replacing ,they were old & scratchy.Wifi connection was non existent in the room .No DVD player or CD player in the room even though booking.com said it was includedNo free newspaper even though booking.com said it was includedPool area needed a spruce up , no umbrella's for shade. You were all packed in like sardines around the pool area .Music was way too loud & booming reverberated in all pool area's."
460,"Some of the amenities are not included and we were told our room had no view and were kind of forced to upgrade to a more expensive one, which wasn't very nice."
461,Got a room with an outside courtyard but was in like a basement area. Only 4m high walls to look at & a kitchen extract which made the area smell of cooking all the time.
462,Not the best location on the strip.  Most of the more fun hotels are further south.
463,"I took a phone call to Australia from the hotel room. That cost me USD114 (yes, you read it correct 114) for less than 15 minute call placed in a very tense situation. Make sure you don't use the telephone provided in the room."
464,"After confirming my reservations through Booking.com more then a week in advance, I was surprised and upset when I was told at the front desk that the suite that I had booked was not available. We had to stay in a handicapped enabled room for one night and we never got the view that we paid for during the whole stay. The service was very impersonal and unprofessional at best. To add on to the situation, I was billed for the smart plan which I had cancelled upon my check in, only to find out when we arrived back home that I was charged for it. Still waiting for the refund."
465,"We asked for in room refridge - they did bring, but did not work.  They did bring another one so it was ok.  Pools - they have many, but they are all smaller and crowded.  One of the pools was so dirty when we were there, that we got lumps of white stuff and hairs all over us.   I have a pool at home, and I can tell you this was not a well cared for pool .   Wish they would invest in better pools, as we adored the rest of the stay and that would make a big difference.  Overall loved it."
466,"The wifi was pretty poor, no breakfast included, the iPod dock was for the old iPhones. It's really nice but I think for the money I expected everything to be perfect."
467,"The Venezia tower rooms are becoming very dated and jaded,2 elevators to get to the room and you are further away from the casino,food court and parking garage."
468,Cleaning of the rooms can be improved. We found the keys of our room dated month of may under our bed (we stayed in August) - so noone really cleaned the floor fully since May.Crowds of people everywhere but this is Vegas.
469,We have extended check out for one of the rooms. But they still check us out even we pay money for it. And it took about 45 minutes to unlock the room
470,Having to ask more than once for luggage to be delivered to room.  The lock on one of our rooms was broken had to be replaced. No apology from hotel and had to chase them to respond.
471,Quieter areas to bathe. There was a constant 'boom-boom' due to a beach pool party.Otherwise pretty perfect.
472,The wifi in the room was terrible but was good everywhere else in the hotel. Only complaint!
473,Coffee making facilities in the rooms would be great.  But that's just a teeny weeny point
474,Normal wifi was useless on iPhone. Had to pay tier 2 to make it work at acceptable speed.Had to move from level 5 to level 24 due to noise of hotels outside aricon system - very noisy.
475,If you need shade at the pool I suggest reserving a cabana as there are no umbrellas at the pool. We missed having a coffee maker in the room however coffee shops are nearby.
476,"Our room was a long way, three lift rides from the main pool.Problem booking through Booking.com. We were overcharged on one room for a child under 13 (the hotel does not charge for children under 13) and we did not receive free breakfasts for our five night stay, on the two rooms booked, as listed on the website and our booking confirmation."
477,We didn't like the fact that Smoking is allows in the Casino area.
478,Front desk lady and her manager named AJ.We are family with 3 girls and 3boysBooked 3 rooms she and her manager didn't do any thing to help us even  though we requested that at booking and we call hotel in the morning while we were traveling from LA to Vegas they try to sell us different room up grade
479,No coffee in the rooms. Would have been great
480,"No coffee maker in room (only to discover you can get a free one per adult somwhere in the foodcourt once leaving)Relatively expensive (25$! For 3 icecreams), but then again it is Vegas.Free wifi is slow. LTE connection was better and fasterYou pay 35$ resort fee bit do not get explained what it is for"
481,It takes forever to get out on to the strip via the shopping malls (but this seems to be the case with all the big hotels). It is expensive (but everything in Vegas is) but worth it. Having been into Circus Circus and Excalibur (other options for kid themed hotels for our stay) we definitely made the right choice
482, those are tired and shady inside. If I were to go back I would not stay anywhere else but Venetian.
483,I asked them to keep some synthetic ice I need to keep cold some medicines in one of their freezer and they refused! I think that similar things should never happen in a hotel of such a high level!
484,"The hotel was so giant we had to take two separate elevators, and use a map, to get to the room but that's to be expected on the strip I suppose!"
485,I didn't have any complaints on the Venetian part.  But the fellow visitors extremely loud when walking down the hall.  But other than that I would definitely be coming back.
486,"The frigi in room is fully sensor ed thus if you remove anything you will be immediately charged for it, this prevent us from getting cold water which is much needed in the heat of Las Vegas, as the hotel is really huge there are always queues on everything from elevators to check in and you name it, if you have a car with valet make sure you order it enough time in advance as it takes 30 mins for valet to deliver car and thus it could be you loose your show if not counting for that, I didn't also like the high priced food in hotel resturants but this is expected in Vegas as a touristic hub"
487,"when I was check in, the front desk ask me to upgrade the room without clear indication that would be charged extra moneyUntil I checked out, it was surprised to see that I was charged for a huge extra money while I had prepaid for the room before."
488,It was very hot and there was a shortage of deck chairs by the pools
489,Doors in the suite didn't close very easily.
490,"Nightly rate was too high, additional resort fee did not cover exercise equipment (?). Drink purchases about 3 x normal cost."
491,"cannot use the refrigerator, no water provided in the room, room too far away (since it is a big hotel with many rooms)"
492,"I didn't like the fact that you have to take two different elevators to get to the suite I find that cumbersome.Staff were not top noch, they didn't belong to this resort.Suite didn't get cleaned well.The water is harsh."
493,"No fridge, it is full with mini bar items that auto charge of they're removed. Check in queues far too long for the money that you pay"
494,"The bottled water inside the fridge are chargeable which is fine, but those on top of the cupboards are also chargeable! I thought they were complimentary and finished them for usd24."
495,"A very noisy hotel - we had to move rooms when a party was going on in the room next door . Upgraded to a larger, higher suite at a reduced price, which was worth the money to get away from the raucous partying in the next room - all day ! Staff very helpful in moving us quickly."
496,The hallway was not clean - overflowing trash cans that were there in the evening as well as the following morning.
497,"In spite of all efforts to ""eat"" smoke, I still find the common casino area too smoky. When moving away from the convention center there is a huge difference in the air quality."
498,- swimming pools overcrowded and loud (this is likely the same in other hotels)- free Wifi useless- housekeeping : we staid 3 nights. The room was not serviced for the 2 days and we had to ask several times. We reported a complaint  to the front desk. The way this issue was solved was professional though.
499,"Do not , and I mean do not, expect 5-star hotel service. I asked for dental kits and a kettle to make hot milk for the baby, and I waited an hour, to get them. The food courts on the lobby floor provide cheaper food choices and that's why the service is terrible !!!!! They don't smile and it seems you are spoiling their day."
500,"Very noisy guests next door,but that is not the hotels fault! When reported security acted quickly and courteously."
501,"Hotel was massive upgraded to a better room in the plazzio side and with a strip view but by the end of the week we all had blisters on our feet so wish I stayed in the Venetian as the pools / food courts were in the Venetian side , both hotels are the same building but BIG"
502,"They place the towels in the shower, so a friend ended up soaking them because the shower head shot at absurd angles. Lots of up and down on elevators to get around to certain floors, I think mostly to keep hotel guests safe but sometimes it was just a bit inconvenient."
503,"Requested early check in from 9-10 but there is no point on that because they don't start preparing you a room until you get there. Totally sucked for us because we had an event to attend at 11, that was our whole point of early check in. So we were expecting to have our room ready as soon as we got there to get situated. Also, receptionist was a little rude, at time of check in."
504,Couldn't fault the place.
505,Better detail cleaning and use of a fridge or something bigger than ice bucket
506,The queues at check in and out were pretty big but they staffed the desks well and they move quite quickly.
507,Couldn't fault the Venetian !! Recommend to anyone wanting 1st class accommodation !!
508,Electronic fridge  one small shelfTo place an item No microwave or coffee makerIn room
509,"Checked in at the Venetian, hotel full.  Moved to Palazzo.  Complicated with valet.  Glass fragments in room and my husband stepped on glass.  Housekeeping forgot room one day."
510,Resort fee bumps underlying price a lot. Just be honest and add into the standard rate as it is a mandatory charge
511,My rooms door lock was pretty annoying took 5-10 swipes to get the thing to open every time
512,The heat...it was 115 F outside.
513,SLOW INTERNET CONNECTION.ROOM CLEANING IS UPON DAILY REQUAST.
514,No tea or coffee making facilities in the room.
515,"The front desk wrote down the wrong room number while checking in 
The safe in the room was already closed when entering the room"
516,"It was 110 degrees and there were no umbrellas around the pool unless you rented a cabana.  It was too hot to lie out in the sun without shade, so we didn't get a chance to relax."
517,Wifi didn't work in our bed room.
518,We waited a long time for valet parking guy to get our car. The hotel was super crowded. When we checked out we would like a bellman but the staff told us there was a 30 min line! Would never stay in this hotel again. Venetian is too famous to live in
519,We cant think of anything we enjoyed ourselves and look forward to come back.
520,"Pool was disgusting with scum and body fats building up in corners, as a pool maintenance person I wouldn't swim in them."
521,The suite we were in was at the end. We didn't not have any closer elevators next to us. Overall not a good experience.
522,Desire to get you lost at every opportunity so you'd end up back at the Casino - or maybe that was just me :-)
523,"Depravity in the streets outside, feeling that the hotel was intent on draining my wallet at every opportunity, feeling that I was a being processed by a machine rather than entertained by a host - whole stay lacked human warmth."
524,"This is a huge hotel, so the staff didn't take the time to get to know us or find out what we were looking for. You can't use the fridge at all because the mini bar is weighted and they charge you if anything moves. The smoking in the casino was off putting. We didn't gamble much because of this. They should have a non-smoking area."
525,The bathtoom toiletries are not being  replace with a new 1 on the next day. And the guest service not helpful.
526,At room the Internet was pour ...
527,"Crowded at all times, older feel to the room, could probably do better for the money being spent"
528,Everything in Vegas is expensive and the food is overpriced and not that great.
529,Bathroom could have been slightly cleaner around taps etc. Hadn't spotted the additional resort fee that was payable so that was an unpleasant shock.
530,Didn't like that there is no tea or coffee facilities in the rooms.
531,"There wasn't any tea or coffee facilities. When I asked for some, I was told I had to go to the mall to purchase a cup of tea. This took about 30 mins round trip each morning! The operator didn't even suggest room service."
532,"The Cigarrette smell.  Got sick due to not being able to breathe and I was staying on the 33rd.floor. Although it must be hard for you guys, you should invest every so often and find ways to keep your air clean, by changing the air ducts or maintaining them so you can save us from ""nose bleeding"", ""chest congestion"" ""headaches""  I must say that Vegas is a city where almost every hotel has this problem, but that is exactly why I want to ask you Venetian, to be better and think of our lungs. Just try it!We pay top dollar for our stay, so please consider your fans :)Thanks!"
533,You need to go into one of the many food areas to choose breakfast.
534,"Very expensive and lots of extras to pay for, no tea and coffee facilities in room, staff not very helpful at all I was sick one evening and they refused to give us water so I could take my medicine I had to pay $4 for it!!"
535,"Slow internet, I have to walk like 5 minutes and take two elevator till I arrived to lobby plus 20 min waiting for my car.They charge me additional money after I checked out and get my final bill.I'll never stay there again"
536,No negatives!
537,The hotel was So Big .... Lots of Walking.
538,"Even though the room was awesome, it was more than we needed because we spent most of our time out of it. And I think we paid more than we needed to for that big, luxurious room. Next time, I'll probably try to save some money by looking something smaller. If I can do that at the Venetian, then I will be back!"
539,"The rooms were smaller than other similar priced rooms, the facilities are mostly all in the Palazzo and you have to walk FOREVER to get anywhere. And worst of all, there is cigarette smoke EVERYWHERE-- your clothes and hair stink of smoke even if you are just going from your room to the front door/taxi.  Noise also travels a lot so the room is very noisy."
540,"I was offended by the quality, security, and location of the parking garage and the fact that there was a hidden resort fee added to my bill. The staff recommended Merrrils Steak House as the best for dining! It was not, in fact the wait staff could not communicate the menu properly and the meal was at best mediocre. The stake was overpriced, undercooked, and cold. The baked potato was undercooked and difficult to consume the temperature of the potato had no effect on the butter!"
541,"Unable to use resort credit at certain stores even though they were on the applicable resort credit list (i.e. Lobster Me, Carlos' Bakery). The smell of cigarettes when walking through casino."
542,"- Slightly untidy bathroom and bedspread (or whatever the small ornamental thing is on the bed) for what we expected, however the issue was resolved immediately when we mentioned about it"
543,"A lot of the restaurants at the Venetian were closed for private parties, due to a large convention.(it was Las Vegas restaurant week) It would have been good to know in advance that this was going to be the case. Would have picked a different week to stay."
544,"The parking arrangement was very confusing, even with the Valet service which is to the far left side around the corner. We got sent all the way into the parking garage's valet which is for the Canal Shoppes and had to come all the way down and find our way back to the far left side of the front of the hotel."
545,WiFi wasn't that great. As it's so maybe it's pretty hard to work your way around and the signage isn't great.
546,"The room  needs a refrigerator that you can actually put leftovers and water in (it is stocked with beer, drinks that you pay for) and a coffee maker."
547,"Service really poor and reported this twice, directly to management, without any feedback or reply.Nothing in the hotel was op to eat early afternoon.   Shocker!Rooms are 20 minute walk from reception."
548,Air conditioning on the hallways too cold - always needed a jacket. Very long ways to reach room from lobby.
549,It was hot but that has nothing to do with the hotel.
550,"Don't go to the Bouchon, the hostess and staff don't give a damn about you.Room cleaning was below expected."
551,Rooms are not meant for family stays. No complimentary water or coffeemaker machine in the room. Worst was the bathroom which was stinking.
552,Grazie membership was totally confusing and we didn't really take advantage of it.
553,"People smoking at swimming pool while there were also children, it can't be that difficult to stop smoking for the time at the swimming pool."
554,No tea maker in room. Travelled with an young child and hot water to be called from room service would take an hour.
555,Turned out it's cheaper to book on their official website than anywhere which also gives you extra credit for casino.
556,It was slightly more expensive than I would have liked.
557,"The staff is not helpful. When we arrived the reception desk at 2 a.m. , the staff just told me my room was cancelled with out a double check. And we have to explain a lot despite we were already exhausted. Although ,in the end, it was proved a mistake of the receptionist, he did give an apology at all. In addition, the wifi is quite poor..."
558,Not provide COFFEE MAKER MACHINE in room.
559,There's no tea kettle in the room. And what kind of a 5 star makes you carry your own bags to the room?
560,A little pricey for not including things like a kitchen or fridge for beverage storage.
561,"There is a charge for EVERYTHING, which is pretty standard for Las Vegas, but is also annoying. and be careful of the the ""refreshment bar"" it's weight sensitive so if you pick up an item for more than 30 seconds you will be charged for it"
562,There needs to be a his and hers light switch on either side of the bed. A detachable shower head would be great. No electric kettle. House keeping sometimes a bit rude and cleaning not excellent some days (we got chocolate some days and not others and the same for amenities - soaps etc) . Bedside radio needs updating.
563,"Booked around 6 months in advance and requested a smoking room. They didn't have a king smoking at check in but set me up with a double queen smoking room. The first room was terrible. There was trash in the drawers and cabnets and the drain on the tub was broken. The staff was very helpful after I called to complain. They cleaned the room and set me up with a king smoking room on the strip for the next three nights of my stay. They also waived all of the resort and wifi fees at checkout. Overall, I was very satisfied with how they made up for the shortfalls of my first night's stay."
564,"Difficulty when calling front desk for items like more towels .... No one would show up.... Called front desk several times and called house keeping, but it was a minor inconvenience. Overall really enjoyed our stay!!"
565,Would have liked a fridge that guests could use instead of one stocked with overpriced drinks-but that seems to be the norm in Vegas!
566,I couldn't complain about anything in this hotel
567,"Added fees for things. Resort fees, should be built into the advertised price. Paying extra for a fridge of your own to keep things as there is no room in their minibar fridge & if you even move stuff they know. Pools not open long enough in the heat of summer."
568,"They made a mistake at check in and give us an occupied room, they repair it with an upgrade for a room with an excellent view."
569,"I used the Valet parking and my car was in their care the entire time as I used a cab to get everywhere. When I got my car back I noticed a large dent and red paint on the passenger side. When I called and spoke to security to see video  footage the manager said they don't have security cameras, my car is an 06 and the dent could have been there (as if I don't know my own car and take care of it) and she spoke down on me which I didn't appreciate. For all of the money I spent there I definitely did not feel like a valued customer and nothing was done. Nothing was offered, no solutions. It's a beautiful place but I will never stay there again. EVER"
570,"Pool area, no shade except for buildings, no room to move as beds are lined up next to each other. Too many people and too little space.Casino area all smoking except for one tiny uninteresting area, put us off spending time there.Pride themselves on being the largest complex in LV with 7000 rooms, if full with an average of 2 people to a room thats 14,000 people - horrid, impersonal, not my cup of tea but if you want a brash, false, plastic environment in LV then this is it"
571,No Coffee/tea making facilities in the room which is not good when you have to travel half a mile to get to the nearest cafe in the morning. Food quite expensive. drinks very expensive (free apart from tip if you are at the tables)
572,"Breakfast is expensive (for the price it should be included), no ""personal touch"" from the staff"
573,It was very busy all the time some noisy people in the hall in the AM after a long night of partying...normal I guess
574,It is a considerable distance from the front of the hotel to the rooms (it's a 7000 room hotel!) but if you follow the signs you won't get lost. Smoking is allowed in the casino and unfortunately you have to walk through the casino to get to and from the room. The pool filtration system didn't seem effective late on a hot day.
575,"Too far to Parking Area, Guest have to move bagage across CASINO to check in. Waiting too long during check in and out."
576,"1- its too big ,our suit was around 5 minutes walking and two elevators2- rude staff at the swimming pool party, they forced us to walk all the way back to our suit to get our passport for age verification even though we are both above 43 years old,and when we brought the passport he didn't bother to open them.3-every 5 star hotel in the world has a coffee machine in the room with complementary coffee,i was shocked that they dont have and they charge 22 dollars for a pot of coffee .4- I Am A Type 1 Diabetic and on my last night before check out i needed to freeze my ice packs so i can keep my insulin cold,unfortunately even though we are in a a luxury suit but there is no freezer which i can understand,so i called room service so they can put my ice packs in the hotel freezer but they refused, i have don't that in every hotel i have been in the last 20 years and never been turned down.5- my friend suggested that we can ask for ice bucket and put the ice packs inside it ,we called them they said we charge for ice and we paid 5-10 dollars for that i forgot the exact amount.  (we had no choice)6- room service cleans the room and takes all the ashtray with her maybe because they want you to ask for them and tip them."
577,I had an excursion organized to grand Canyon was very hard to find the location of where the bus was waiting nearly missed my bus - not enough indications or signs. (made it at the end thank to the staff who were nice to point me to the right direction).
578,The wifi in the hotel was very temperamental and I struggled to have a connection at all.
579,No complementary items.not even tea or water. Have to pay for the electric cattle or any other thing. At Venetian nothing comes for free..I wonder they may not start charging to breath air..
580,Canal Shoppes area where people try to give you cheap show tickets by trying to get you to go to a timeshare resort presentation.
581,Nothing.  Everything met or exceeded expectations!
582,"Booking.com used my middle name as last name so it took longer to find the reservation, happened to us and friends we flew in with."
583,The rooms are tired and need to be updated. The mattress was way too soft and not comfortable.
584,Bedside light could only be turned off on one side which was difficult .
585,We were a bit disappointed with the shower as it was a little weak.
586,Poor odds on gaming tables.  6/5 pay on a blackjack and hitting soft 17 gives the house too big of an edge.  Comps are non-existent.  No real incentive to visit poker room.
587,Be very careful about the final bill. The price showing in booking.com is not the same as at the hotel when you check out. I arrived at noon but check in time was 3 Pm. Front desk talked me to take his deal which is 40$ more and I can go to my room now . I took the deal. When I check out I was charged 55$ plus tax more per nights. Every single nights we stayed. Very dishonest . Tricky .
588,I didn't like the tax and resort fee I feel I was overcharged because when I paid through booking.com it said the price is including the tax I paid 722dirhams on booking.com then I paid again in the resort 35dollars I don't for what.
589,The young teenagers were a bit noisy do not come over at weekends . the walls being a bit thin between the rooms allows the noise from the party next door to penetrate through.
590,All good but as sooooo vast it's very easy to lose your bearings....... Umbrellas needed by pool area with sun beds-gets very hot and NO shade!
591,"Noisy people at all times of night.Don't touch anything in mini bar as you will get charged as if you have used the items, works on censors"
592,I got reservations for Venetian not palazzo and they charge for wifi.... We also found toys and a paper air plane when we walked in the room and a left cup full of milk in the fridge
593,Wifi was slow
594,"First of all we didn't know that the hotel has some very attractive poker room rates, if you play more than 6 hrs/ night you stay. My husband played and he found out from the dealer at the poker room.Then the bad news was that the room rate was only available if the room was booked directly with the hotel, not via a third party, i.e. via booking.com. That was really disappointing. So next time I think we will book directly with the hotel."
595,The security looks at your face and decides if they wanna see your room key or not before letting you into the residence tower. I need not elaborate about which type of faces they ask for the key.
596,I didn't like how after paying all that money there was no fridge or coffee maker.
597,Only thing when I took a bath and drained the tub I wanted to shower but the drained backed up some from the tub.
598,Paid extra to upgrade to a view of the strip but we were right on the bend of the strip so didn't really get a view to speak of. Also charged an extra $5 for something out of the minibar but we didn't have anything from the minibar.
599,"Pool was very busy, almost impossible to get a chair past 10am, unless you pay the staff to kick others off them. Breakfast buffet was over rated for the price and selection. The bath tub and shower stall backed up brining stinky mess into bathroom- room was upgraded but still a hassle."
600,"There was nothing we didn't like, everything was perfect.  Tea/coffee facilities in the rooms would have been greatly appreciated just for that first morning cuppa."
601,"- given the high room prices I'd have expected, that a bottle of water is included in the price, but it wasn't- due to the size of the hotel, it feld a little bit anonymous"
602,"Front desk staff rude and snobby! Had to call housekeeping on arrival as bins not emptied, ball of hair in shower and bar snacks opened and not replaced. 2 of us celebrating our 50th, one during our stay. A request for anything complimentary was flatly turned down. A glass of wine or slice of cake would have been appreciated.  Will try the Bellagio next year."
603,Dirty counter on mini bar. Otherwise not much I didn't like.
604,"Our paid upgrade to include a view wasn't as good as expected. Not a huge range of TV channels, and no guide. Additional 30% on menu prices for room service, plus gratuity (plus optional tip) - quite expensive."
605,The shower was a bit old.
606,"We were in another tower, which meant changing 2 lifts. It was a pain and also there was no breakfast available at the hotel. It became a problem with the little ones."
607,"Room cleaning is very late , mostly 3-5 p.mnot enough bath towels.Houskiping staff is not enough ."
608,Room too far and not convenient. Too noisy at night so we had to change the room. The whole hotel was too busy and noisy.
609,No coffee and tea set to make warm tea or coffee in the morning. No complementary drink despite the room price.
610,"pool size,  must be more easy find exits, entrances, we never sow so a lot lost people in like labirints buildings. Food market's  food and service dangerously bad. Employee very aggressive and helpless."
611,Not enough room at the pool.
612,Just nothing.
613,The sheer size of the hotel made it very easy to get lost on multiple occassions!
614,Week end rates a bit expensive especially when getting asked about upgrades when you are paying top dollarI would suggest a comp upgrade if avail when paying week end rates
615,Booked a suite with view only saw the poolNo tea or coffee making facilities in room and mini bar is sensors so if you look at something you get charged for it
616,"There's no free bottle water in room, you have to ask the front counter. We loose money in casino  :("
617,You are charged automatically if you move the things around in mini-bar. A clear and visible sign should be posted at the mini-bar to warn occupant. I have to call to reverse the charges.
618,"There was a guy his name was joseph , 10 pm he was trying to bargin us into a room with a double bed instead of giving us a room with a king size bed after the long argue he went to his manager and magically after him saying tht he had no room with king bed available he came up with one in 2 min. So just becareful , also no kettle in the room no tea no slippers"
619,It would have been better if we were able to stay 5 days!!!  lol
620,The location of the room was horrible. For this reason we chose to gamble at another hotel.
621,The price per night was little bit on the higher side comparing it to deals other hotels were having.
622,"having only spent 1 night, we wish we could have stayed longer."
623,"Over priced, no toilet roll in room, no kettle in room, not enough direction signs for a maze like network of corridors and lifts"
624,"Staff in the casino were rude, dismissive and generally quite miserable, particularly in comparison to some other hotels on the strip"
625,"Bit disappointed that there were no tea/coffee facilities provided, for the price you pay you would expect at least a complimentary bottle of water and tea/coffee supplies."
626,"Where do I even start! Appalling! The staff were awful. We arrived late
and tired and our reservation was for 2 non smoking luxury suites to be
told they only had smoking ones available. This is not okay and mu
parents who also stayed have horrid allergies you couldn't breathe
on the floor they Sent us and then told us if we wanted to move we
would be downgraded. We came to terms with this and had a major
struggle with the staff even wanting to help us. They were extremely
rude and to cancel they charge almost the whole cost of the stay. So we
got moved and were very thankful for it however there were other guests
partying with their doors open in the surrounding rooms as well as
running up and down the hallways screaming all night. I'm talking
even between 1-5am. Totally unacceptable. What did the hotel do?
Nothing - of course. I went to have a bath to find after I had filled
it up that I was sitting in a totally unclean bath with other
people's hair floating in it, totally gross! So I went to drain the
bath which actually made dirty sewerage (black smelly) come up the
drain of my shower. This is extremely disgusting. I have stayed at The
Tropicana before (on the end of the strip) for a whole week and hat was
amazing. You would think that paying 2-3 times the price and in a
better location, more ""prestigious"" hotel that is would be as
good as it seems. Totally disgusted with the cleanliness and service
received. Never. Again."
627,No Housekeeping. Our room was only cleaned after we complained it three times. The staff didn't take care about it. This is not a five star luxury hotel worthy. I was shortly before buying my own toilet paper at Walgreens. I'm not kidding.
628,- Had to call room service several times to remove the dishes after having a meal in the room.
629,There were some anomalies on on or check out bill that we were able to get corrected quickly.
630,"there were 3 of us...I took the sofa.  When I pulled out the hide-a-bed, I found damp soiled sheets, with used items in the sheets....very  unpleasant situation."
631,The only thing I missed was a kettle or coffee machine in the room .
632,"the hotel is so big, you end up walking alot."
633,The double doors to the bathroom looked good but weren't very practical. The hinges needed oiling too.  There was also a used cotton bud on the floor when we arrived.
634,"Service is very in efficiency. Wifi is tooooo bad, no connection! Noisy. Too difficult to find the room."
635,Wifi could be of a better speed/quality.
636,No coffee/tea facilities in the room. Surely this is a basic requirement that should be included within the daily resort fee.
637,"In my opinion I think the guest of the venetian should get deals on TAO nightclub, or the pool parties. I honestly thought we were going to get discounts or a deal on bottle service just for being a guest."
638,"Staff, especially the dealers in the casino, were super unfriendly.  I have been to severaldifferent casinos and these dealers were the worst I've seen."
639,Hard to rate staff as had little interaction with them due to scale. Smell of casinos due to cigarette smoke off putting. We also asked for highest room available with a nice view. We got 11th floor so not particularly high and crappy view :(
640,Too big and easy to get lostNearly everything in the room charges you.
641,"The view was ugly, but to be honest we didn't spend a lot of time in the room. Like with all American hotels, no price is ever up front. A variety of taxes and resort fees appear on your bill so expect to pay more than what's quoted on booking. Also I would advise buying bottled water from the shops - the in-room temptations (drinks and snacks) are extortionate."
642,"The room smelled bad every time I put the AC off, the Shower water pressure wasn't the best and there's a weird humidity smell as soon as you step into the lobby every day."
643,We arrived early and room was ready but charged extra to access room early - no other hotel has ever done this in any place I have been.
644,"The whole hotel was designed as a big labyrinth, leading you to the casino or to the shops. Not easy to navigate - 20 minutes walking, three lifts and many corridors to get from the car park to the room."
645,Pools were closed due to a little pouring rain..Often is was not even raining at all.
646,"The only problem that I could find with this hotel is that is it simply too big. It takes 2 elevator and 10 min walk just to get from your room to your car, and about the same time to exit the hotel."
647,Nothing!
648,The Smart Plan was overrated. The WiFi didn't work half the time and don't even think about streaming anything as promised. We found that where you could use the 50% off drinks was very limited and the Caffe Presse to get free coffee were in pretty inconvenient areas. Next time we'll skip the plan.
649,"The lighting in the bathroom wasn't the best, it was darker than what I was used to, which made it hard to get ready."
650,"No coffee facilities in the Room,also we didn't like hearing the noise in the corridor of returning guests"
651,"You are just ONE of the many travelers coming to the Venetian, expect to queue up when you arrive, expect to be welcomed by a front-desk lady talking very fast to get through and to your credit card even faster. If you have already booked a ""Venetian suite"" the front-desk will try to upgrade your suite into an even better suite, making you feel like your suite is JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH. You have already paid 300-400 US$ per night!  There is a resort tax of ca. 15% per night to pay on top for every luxury hotel next to taxes. More expensive than planned. The room is dark but you get two TVs."
652,"We didn't like that the check-in clerk tried to convince us to upgrade to the ""floor up"" for an extra $45/night. When we asked what we would get for that, he assured us that we would get a ""much better view"". I'm not sure that a move from the 8th floor to the 9th changes the view all that much? We were entirely happy with the room we were allocated and were also very happy that we hadn't taken the ""one floor up"" option"
653," it would have been a total waste of $90 (for the two nights we were there). Also, we both felt that the check-in agent was not at all welcoming but rather just going through the motions. Yes, we were on an Expedia deal, not sure that should make us second-class guests? We are well travelled and have stayed in literally thousands of hotels all over the world in our quite lengthy lives! This however is the only negative we have to add"
654," we thought the Venetian, overall, was brilliant!"
655,We checked in on Friday evening and were given a suite in the Venezia Tower
656," told that the tower had its own secluded pool which opened from 0630 and stayed open until 2230.  We got to the pool at around 1100 the following day.  It was busy and the sun was limited - the pool is completely surrounded by the tall hotel buildings and so often mostly in shade. Without any warning everyone in the area were suddenly (and quite rudely) cleared away by staff due to a 'private function'.  Several people asked to see the manager - 'not available'.  Were told to move to the main pool area.  All well and good but there were already 1000's people struggling to find anywhere to sit.  The pool area just does not cater for the number of guests.  2 days later, sun shining I headed to the main pool at 9am only to find it cordoned off - no details as to why it was closed. Have stayed in Bellagio and Wynn amongst other hotels and won't be visiting the Venetian again."
657,All the decor is too old grandma for my taste. Next time we are going to stay at a more updated hotel and will have to uber to the restaurants
658,They charged us for a late check out which we did not require
659, after three calls they gave me back the money.
660,"There was a trash bag next to our room for almost a whole day.Considering the rest of the hotel, it was just a lapse, but an important one."
661,Room housekeeping was poor. Garbage left from last guest. All resort staff were grumpy and obviously did not enjoy their work. Resturants are overpriced and average food. Grand Lux Buffet very poor range and qualility public house wait staff had no customer focus. Overall very disappointing and poor value for money.
662,Complex facility--too much walking and multiple elevators to get from one place to another. You can get lost forever... Somewhat expensive
663,Cost of the gondola rides was a bit pricey. No amusement parlour facilities for the kids.
664,"During our four night stay, our suite was cleaned only once, and that was annoying."
665,"Paper thin doors We were there on the weekend and there was a lot of young adults screaming in the corridors all night long - really hard to try to sleep when that happens Also very long walk from the reception to our rooms, but it is a big complex"
666,Didn't experience any unpleasantness this trip
667,Internet is TERRIBLE - it dropped off constantly and often didn't work at all. I expected more from a hotel of this standard.
668,So many people that often had to queue at concierge.
669,I would have liked tea and coffee making facilities in the room
670,Nothing in particular. All was good.
671,The gentleman was not helpful when ordering room service first night we arrived. Then our food took 2 hours to arrive and the order was wrong!
672,Did not get room I wanted .paid extra for strip view Got pool view. Told that  was strip view. Also was offered bed turndown service. Your hotel does not have this.
673,"Gondola rides are good, but are overpriced and the ride time is short."
674,"Key cards deactivated regularly, which entailed a trip to the lobby, a considerable walk through the casino, and often a long line. This occurred at least once a day to each key card (traveled with a group, so several rooms). The hotel needs to update their room keys."
675,A bit overpriced compared to similar hotels offering same size rooms and amenities...about 35-40% pricier than others.
676,"HATED the way the advertised rate turned out to be $100 less than what we paid,we were assessed extra for early check in, with an ""option to move"" after one night-well that wasn't going to work very well.  Too many hidden fees!Left a bad taste, better to be up front."
677,"The check out process could have been more streamlined, but it falls in line with other hotels."
678,The staff. Most of the dealers at the tables were extremely non friendly and miserable. We went to many other casinos and the staff was fantastic. They were great to be around and pleasant.
679,"Just my personal preference but it is a little too far up the strip for me. It's easy to forget how vast each hotel is, and what might only appear to be 2 or 3 hotels away can easily be a 20-minute walk. The TV menu system is also slightly limited in that it doesn't give you a programme guide, just a list of channels... not that watching TV should be a high priority for anyone in Vegas anyway, so just a minor gripe!Also a word of warning that it's not cheap... a bottle of water from a juice bar by the lifts for our hotel cost $5."
680,"All very pricey, so you should expect nothing less than the luxury and service.Felt a bit ripped off by one of the restaurants at the resort but this is probably not the fault of the hotel, itself."
681,THE CHARGES FOR MOVING THE DRINKS FROM THE LITTLE REFRIGERATOR IN THE ROOM.
682,I didn't like that I paid so much for a room but couldn't even receive something as simple as complementary breakfast. Stingy.
683,Could have done without the vacuuming in the hallway at 9:30am and room service arriving at 9:50am. Thought that would have been a big no-no in Vegas!
684,"Very old. For example, Wi-fi which charged me 40 dollars per day was very slow and poor. I couldn't connect to the internet and when I called the IT dept. for help , they told me it was normal. The service was also very poor."
685,"The restaurants - Tao, Grand Luxe Cafe, Bouchon all served mediocre food which did not live up to the price tag & ambienceThe concierge was dreadful.The Tao Pool party and Tao club were low grade compared to the Wynn"
686,The only noise we heard was the opening & closing of the doors in the morning. I am not sure if this was staff ( and thus could be changed) or guests ( and as such not able to be changed).
687,"WE WERE TOLD THAT WE HAD A VEIW OF THE STRIP, SO WE PAID 38.50 A NIGHT FOR THE VEIW. THE ROOM DIDNT HAVE A VEIW SO THEY SWITCH US ONE TIME AND THE SECOND ROOM DIDNT EITHER."
688,although we chose the upgrade on booking we were offered another on arrival and our room did not have a view of anything other than buidling
689,Lack of tea and coffee tray in the room.  It was a trek and a half to find where you cold get your daily tea/coffee included in the mandatory $30 a day resort fee.  Why not be more upfront with actual cost of the suite instead of having a n obligatory add on?
690,The staff tried to sell an upgrade for rooms making it sound like the booked rooms weren't very good to try and persuade you to spend extra on an upgrade. The main pool closed at 6pm even though it was still daylight and really hot. Weren't even allowed to sit on the sun loungers as 'no lifeguard'. The pool on the 10th floor was dirty and smelly and in total shade. It's a ridiculously long way from the car park to the reception to check in. Not easy with luggage. No tea/ coffee making facilities in the room. Not even a complimentary bottle of water. (The mini bar prices were extortionate!)
691,Hallways smelt like an old ashtray on the way to my non-smoking room. You are constantly bothered by vacation property venders and makeup venders while walking thru the hotel shops. That doesn't happen in Caesars. When you say something about the venders the staff at desk simply smiles and says they will pass it along. And remember to read everything when you sign in. There is a resort fee at checkout
692,I always lose lot of money in blackjack
693,"We booked a non-smoking room with a view more than two weeks in advance. When we arrived there about 10pm, the recptionist asked us if we wanted a bigger room. We told no, we would like to have the one we booked. Then he changed to a confidential voice and told us that anyways he upgrades us because we stay for two nights and they appreciate this. We were like, well, ok. Then he even questioned us why we are not enthusiastic about his offer. After when he was talking about how great the room is, he mentioned that we can even smoke in it. We said that we want the original room then, because we hate the smell of cigarette, this is why we booked a non-smoking room. This was the point when he revealed why he ""upgraded"" us, to a bigger, but  darker, smelly, smoking room with a view to the parking lot. The room we booked through booking.com two weeks earlier was not available! The next day when we complained they changed to the original suit, which was really nice. Its a shame that we had to have a bad experience for half of our stay for this rate. Moreover they tried to trick us first to buy the upgrade. Moreover the Casino is unbearably smelly because of the smell of cigarette, but you have to go through to get to the rooms and restaurants from the reception. Unfortunatelly in all Hotel casinos we have been to in Nevada  are smoking areas. Therefore we could loose only $10, because we couldn't stay more in the cigarette smoke. :) A separated, closed area would be needed for smokers."
694,After I get back to my room at night nearly 9 pm I found the room not clean. I called them three times during two hours to send someone to clean my room and every time they say in their way then wait a while at the end she answered my call saying they closed your request then directly my response was do not send anyone I want to sleep.
695,The hotel was like a giant maze! The layout is horrible.  I had to take 3 elevators just to get to my room from valet. There is no direct path to the floors. It took 2 days to learn our way back and forth to the car.  It made us not want to leave the room. :-( .
696,Door seemed thin and could hear everything from the corridoor.
697,The eateries around the casino were not in keeping with the quality of the hotel - a bit 'fast food' which was a shame.
698,Extremely loud people in the hallway. Not the hotels fault.
699,Internet in the hotel room did not work. Spent an hour on the phone with a rep from the hotel with no resolve and spent 4 days without the promised included wifi access. Toilet broke on the second day there and took an entire day for someone to come and fix it.
700,"the valet took the car from the front and parked it. in the process he put a big 8"" scrape of yellow paint above the rear driver side wheel. it was a rental car.... i'll never let the valet at any place take my car again. the last two valet parking jobs in two hotel stays (in different states) have resulted in real problems."
701,"The noise from Tao beach pool with the base and volume far too loud.  If you were sunbathing by the pool next door, it was overpowering."
702,The resort fee was a bit surprising to us and only knew of this when we arrived at the location.  Finding our room was a challenge but then this is a large facility.
703,Restaurants were expensive
704," we didn't like being hounded by touts in the grand canal area and hotel lobby, trying to get us to visit a time-share or selling trips etc"
705," the smell of smoke was evident both in the casino and in the corridors of the guest bedrooms, which was a little off-putting."
706,Nothing at all!
707,"My wife and I were spending out 10 year anniversary at the Venetian. Upon checking in they did the usual update to try and get us to upgrade. The woman at the counter spoke very quickly and it was very loud with the number of people around. She said ""would you like to upgrade your room to a strip view for 45?"" I asked my wife and she really didn't want to, I asked the woman ""just 45?"" she said ""yes"". I figured well for 45 bucks why not we are on our anniversary.   They give me the form and asked ""sign there"". We get up to our room and what did we get for our ""strip view?"" We see the swimming pool, treasure island and the back side of the Palazzo. If you got near the glass and looked to the side you could see the strip. Again my wife was wanting to get our original room. I was still like hey we only paid 45 dollars. It was not till we left to see they charged us 50 dollars a night. After speaking with Thomas the manager what is their response? ""Well you signed the registration card"". It appears their staff who is checking you in are trained to not give you all the information because we double checked with ours and then get you to sign quickly because once you do your screwed. We have stayed at more than one hotel in Vegas and this is the first time we have been screwed over like this. Maybe this is a live and learn experience but no other hotel has done this they have all been upfront or didn't attempt to up sell. If you do decide to stay here make them explain everything in detail. I would recommend the MGM Grand over the Venetian. Maybe not as fancy looking inside but much better value for your money, just as comfortable beds and have never tried to use tricky up sale tricks."
708,"Service very poor. No housekeeping one night, no replacement toiletries or towels another night. No attention to guest services which is what i expect for the money. Would not recommend it. Very disappointing"

710,The view from the room was a brick wall. And there was a mix up when we checked in whereby the total amount was taken off my debit card which I thought they wanted for ID. I was then told the money wouldn't go back into my account for 7 working days but at this point I had already paid (again) on credit card. Staff were not apologetic at all and I felt like it wasn't explained. It was a lot of money taken at the start of a 6 day trip!

1481,It took a very long time for service to come and ended up walking my bags to the room.
1482,"the room was not cleaned, we found several marks smudges and food left around"
1483,smell of smoke in hotel lobby and other places - only casino we have smelled cigarette smoke in in years in Las Vegas
1484,"View was of back/employee entrance (guessing this is why the curtain didn't even open). Big tub, but no jets!"
1485,The Tao pool party music was way too heavy with the same set both days we visited.
1486,The view was the parking garage wall and other facilities ugliness. That was disappointing. It would be so nice to be able to have a cup of coffee in the room (without ordering room service). Great options to get coffee and tea downstairs but you have to be dressed and rolling. .
1487,"We had a very bad experience there. When we checked in, they didn't clean the room completely. Also the window is broken, it couldn't block the wind. We waste a lot of time for communicating with hotel."
1488,Smoking was allowed in the casino and tables!
1489,"Very expensive,charged extra 45 per night for view which was poor and another 35 per night for amenities such as with fi which again was very poor"
1490,Hard to find our way around the hotel at times due to sheer size
1491,"I didnt like that the windows are not open-able which makes a very funny smell in the rooms and on the corridors. Its a huge building with no access to fresh air, except the ventilation and re-circulation of the air. In some rooms you can feel a strong smell of humidity and mold.In the building everywhere it is very very cold.The ventilation system from the room is either very cold or hot and dry, which makes uncomfortable staying and sleeping in the room.Although in the bath there is tube and shower, none of them have a flexible long hose for the shower. The shower cabin has fix shower nozzle very uncomfortable to wash on lower parts of the body and always have to wear a cap not to wet your hair. 3 days in row we didnt have enough towels in the bath and we had to ask every time. The same for sleepers.This is a mass hotel (more than 3000 rooms)and definitely the services (including room supply and cleaning) cannot be at 5 star hotel level.The hotel can be visited at any level rooms, pool, restaurants, casinos, shops, by anybody at any moment so it is not need to stay in this hotel and pay the high."
1492,"The uncourtious staff, the understaffed hotel (it took 20 minutes for front desk to pick a call), basics like tea, coffee, access to pool, steam and sauna were available to hotel guests at a steep additional cost. Nobody cared to do anything for a complaint against housekeeping and the thermometer I asked for after falling sick costed me 31 USD."
1493,"I didn't like that you couldn't use the refrigerator. It is packed with minibar stuff, which are connected to sensors that once you move the items, you are charged automatically."
1494,Ringing our door bell at 8:52 AM on day of check out to ask me when I want my room cleaned! The first rule of the hospitality business is to make your guests feel welcome. Read that again.
1495,The room and hallway still smell of smoke which requested non smoking. The walls were thin to hear other guestd. Ice bucket too small. Parking and valet confusing to go which hotel. Pools were cold never warmed up.
1496,"Pool was not that impressive especially Tao beach. Went through a lot of security scrutiny for a whole lot of nothing on the other side. Crowded, no seats and small jacuzzi size pool. Expected a lot better."
1497,Staff at check in not very helpful and even when we checked out they did not even ask of everything was ok with our stay. They were more interested taking the charges for the room.
1498,No coffee service in the rooms.  Long walk to exit the hotel.  Mini bar charges for picking up the items and no sign letting you know.
1499,Tried charging wrong mini bar consumptions. Beware of putting your stuff in the mini firdge since the system automatically understands you had something from the mini bar.
1500,"We were very disappointed with the service at Bouchon. It was my wife's birthday I made reservations well in advance, and we were not spoken to for 20-25 minutes. We ended up walking out."
1501,It's a little hard to navigate as it is so large.
1502,...chewed/dried chewing gum stuck onto one of the painting on the bathroom wall is unacceptable...One of the front desk staff at the spa was not helpful
1503,Accidently selected a movie and came straight out of it but was still billed $18.99 which I thought was a bit unfair but apart from that no other issues.
1504,For a 5 star hotel the wifi wasn't great at all.could do with a boost.
