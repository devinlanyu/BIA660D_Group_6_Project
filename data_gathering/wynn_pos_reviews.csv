1,"hotel is excellent throughout.  position is great.
Our room was fantastic-it was an upgrade as we were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary"
2,"Room service is delicious!  Thanks, Louis for you care in setting up our breakfast. Beautiful room with fantastic view of the strip."
3,"It's a luxorious yet very interesting hotel. The details and the amount of amenities is astonishing. The rooms are big and the bathrooms are enormous. My room had an astonishing view to the mountains, overlooking the city lights, Treasure Island, The Mirage and if you go closer and see left you see more of the strip, with an entire wall as a window."
4,"Service, comfort staff, shows excellent, expected no less from the Wynn."
5,"My first time staying at a 5 star hotel. I don't think I want to go back to any other kind. The staff was super polite; everything worked and was made possible (for example, I was able to store my luggage at the property after check out, as my flight left later on). Life in a 5 star hotel is just that much more beautiful. And I think Wynn and Encore are exceptionally beautiful! I wish I could've stayed longer."
6,"This is the Wynn, the mighty Wynn. They set the benchmark for what a hotel can be. If the devil is in the detail, Wynn is where all devils work to make a hotel. (Pun intended, this is Vegas after all). Every small detail is taken cared of and executed well. It was a pleasure to be back in Wynn again."
7,"Great facilities . Property is impressive , clean . Casino is nice."
8,Nothing stands out.
9,"I cannot really complain about the Wynn as the hotel is a classic luxury hotel, the beds were comfortable, the view out of the window was great, the staff were pleasant and helpful and efficient. However it was all a bit meh.... There is nothing spectacular or quirky or very interesting about the place. It is just a straightforward, very expensive, luxury hotel with zero character. On previous trips to Las Vegas I have stayed in other hotels - the Bellagio and the Venetian and I prefer the Venetian by far as it has a bit more character and interest (the canals). The Bellagio has the fabulous fountains and great floral arrangements in the public areas. I would recommend those two hotels over the Wynn if you are going to spend that kind of money.  Also you do not need to book the panoramic rooms as the views from the  less expensive rooms  are just as good if not better. The rooms that overlook the golf course have a better view."
10,Overall it was wonderful as I had remember 7 years ago when I came in. One thing I would like to point out I totally had nothing to talk about but thumbs up for Wynn. Thus l was a little shock when there was no bath room slippers. You will need to call to request for it and I think they might not be able to offer it to you if they don have it. For the standard they were. I guess I would have to said they did drop.
11,I left my card purse on a machine and walked off - I realized five minutes later - I inquired and security had already taken it to list and found - spectacular - security - most important of all we are safe here and staff are all happy to do their job
12,"Location, Room and the views"
13,Very nice architecture and decoration. Le reve show was stunning and breathtaking.
14,The scenic view from floor to ceiling windows. The furnishings and Christmas decorations. The electronic controls in the room.

18,This property is so well designed and supremely managed. This is the number one hotel and casino in LV. The others are relatively tacky and poorly run. Well done Wynns and thank you for a superb stay.
19,Beds were awesome. Room was palatial. Views of Las Vegas were great. Pool was great with plenty of room and poolside service.  Loved this hotel.

24,THE PLACE HAS THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING

They're staffs are very accommodating and friendly. The room we got with a fantastic view facing the golf course and it's pretty clean. We, love the buffet especially for breakfast.

33,"Many amenities like clubs, cafes, restaurants etc. Within easy walking distance of everything we needed."

35,Room had great view of the golf course and was very spacious and very modern

The interior is outstanding, many details to appreciate and contemplate at.
Le Reve show at the hotel is a must see.
Designers clothing like Chanel, Dior, LV etc... range of price is similar to the international market and not exaggerated or overrated."
44,Location is good because it has the theater for the show I reserved
45,"The whole hotel has more of an upper class about its self, than other hotels I have stayed in Las Vegas.The bars,restaurants and the casino the staff where fantastic I could not have been happier with the whole stay.

THANKS WYNN"
69,The Wynn is a beautiful hotel and has great rooms that are understated-not your typical Vegas room.
70,"The decor of the hotel was amazingly beautiful and the room was enormous, decorated beautifully and very clean, the spa was top notch, restaurant delicious"
71,"The staff were horrible. Wait staff at all restaurants (tried to get
coffee at one restaurant and said he did not want to make it and sent us
to the coffee stand at Tableau). We paid the 40.00 resort fee. Long wait
to check in and did not get to the pool until 3. They kicked everyone
out of the pool at 6:45. They have a no pet policy. Was traveling with a
friend and she has a support animal and they refused her at check in.
She had to find a room at another hotel last minute."
72,"It was absolutely mind blowing. The property is stunning, there is so much beauty everywhere it took over an hour to walk around the hotel and appreciate the art. There's fresh flowers everywhere, it is magnificent! The room was breathtakingly beautiful and I have never slept in a more comfortable bed. I believe the Wynn have their own brand of sheets..? The food was delicious and so refined. We will be going back there for sure."
73,The hotel and rooms are extremely nice and luxurious. The location is a little bit far from the central Las Vegas Strip.
74,Everything was amazing. The rooms were beautiful. The casinos were clean. All the food was amazing. Can't wait to come back. I won't stay anywhere else in Vegas
75,"The room was wonderful, the staff is terrific. Paying for the room is one thing, a ""resort-fee"" of $39.00 is another. All bars and restaurants are extremely expensive, even of Las Vegas Upscale properties."
76,Beautiful hotel interior.
77,"This hotel was wonderful, the bed was like a cloud, the view was spectacular, 53rd floor!! 
We had dinner at the SW Steakhouse, the vibe was beautiful and the dinner was a 10/10, I strongly recommend it!

Make sure you take a swimm in their beautiful pool before you leave!"

Good food and bartenders in the (only) bar that serves food in the late evening - can't recall its name but very good especially the eldest guy."
89,"Our room was gorgeous - we loved the view, and the bed in particular was extremely comfy. The button by the bed that opens the curtains in the morning was a nice feature. Also, the toiletries were good quality and it was nice to have the option of a bath or shower. 
In the hotel itself, we liked that the place did not reek of smoke like other hotels in Vegas. Also, the Parasol bars were a great place for a drink with friends in the evening."

91,The chef - Russell I think was fantastic with showing me the vegan options at the buffet.
92,Room was very nice.

96,"Beds were very comfortable, bathroom size was nice & shower pressure was very good ."
97,The beds are super comfy
98,Steve Wynn seems to learn from every hotel he develops and just makes the next one that little bit more special.
99,"Hotel is great....,very busy though and too much smoke in and around access to hotel room elevators."
100,The majority of the staff were courtious and helpful. The resort is kept very clean and hospitable.
101,"- Heated swimming pool
- Entertainment (DJ's at the nightclub). We had David Guetta :)

Quiet
Never need to wait for elevators."
111,Everything was exceptionally spectacular as expected!  I seriously kept my toiletries in my bag until I was ready to use them because the bathroom was so nice I didn't want to clutter it my personal stuff.  Didn't even want to walk around the room with my shoes on.  A rare occasion that a hotel makes me feel this way.
112,The design of the hotel and its colors are awesome. Too luxury hotelüëåüèº.
113,"Had a sizeable Tower Suites room at rear of hotel with views over the golf course. Very comfortable bed, large ensuite with both bath and a large shower. Excellent informative service in the Tower Bar. Helpful staff everywhere. A first rate hotel."
114,Not a  good experience the room I paid for I did not get it and I also got  no view whatsoever I was also told I was going to get hotel credit which I didn't  receive
115,"We had a very large beautiful room with the most incredible view of the mountain range and the Strip.  The entire staff was so very nice, professional, and helpful!  We would highly recommend the Wynn hotel and we can't wait to go back there."
116,"The hotel is beautiful!
The room was decorated in a very modern style, with a lot of attention to detail. Bathroom was very big and offered shower, tub 2 sinks and a vanity. Extremely spacious and luxurious.
The hotel itself offers several excellent restaurants."
117,dining options are incredible as is room service. Also like the level of quality of casinos and gaming-- even seats at slots are covered in top of the line buttery leather.
118,"The bed was very comfortable, the room was big and very clean. It's a beautiful resort, and the Jardin restaurant was amazing."

121,The Allegro Restaurant served amazing food. The show was wonderful but a little overpriced.
122,Location is excellent if you only have a few days and want to combine some shopping (right next to the big mall and high end stores) with some gambling! Casino environment is much nicer than many of the others on the strip and quality of dining options and facilities is excellent
123,"Everything ! The city, the hotel's clean facilities and the magnificent in room dining team that provided the most delicious food. The staff were fabulous. A special mention to Bri, from Registration, who checked us in. She was so thorough and smooth in her approach. Checking in was a breeze and she gave us the loveliest room on the top floor (60th) with a stunning, bejewelled view of the glittering strip. Such a panoramic view of the city as well. An extremely pleasant and friendly young lady. Cheers and thanks Bri."
124,"The room was fantastic, gym facility was great, bed comfortable, view marvelous. I particularly enjoyed watching the hot air balloons drifting over the snow capped hills in the soft light of the rising sun. Probably would have enjoyed being in the balloon more, though! Staff were friendly and helpful. The show was stunning, amazing."
125,Our family loved everything about the hotel/resort and we will definitely be coming back again!

139,The hotel was beautiful and set up nicely. We enjoyed eating at the SW and gaming on the casino floor. We like the newer video gaming machines and Wynn had a lot to play.
140,"Excellent, but very expensive"
141,The breakfast buffet.
142,"The view from Tower Suites is exceptional! 
The pool area is so chilled, with a nice vibe of old and new music playing. 
La Cave restaurant was superb if you want a mix of traditional and new flavours. 
The Wynn creates a calm atmosphere away from the bright casino lights and busy nightlife. 
It's was perfect location to enjoy Vegas!"
143,"The staff was extremely accommodating with all of our requests.  Food was spectacular, the entire property was immaculate, we were totally wowed."
144,"The room was beautiful; the color, the amenities, but it was the lighting options that provided us a tranquil retreat. An oversized bathtub that I indulged in, crisp Egyptian 1000 count sheets engulfed me like a fluffy cloud of silk and cotton."

151,"Good - Amazing building with so many details. Great views of the mountains and the strip from the 59th floor. Staff was beyond friendly - so helpful in every way.  Food in all the restaurants was excellent - flavorful and fresh.  European pool was lovely, even in October (but why, why did the  Palazzo have to blot out the last 2 golden afternoon hours worth - shaking my fist). Spa access for $40/day is totally worth it - most relaxing place to go after a whirlwind of noise and energy."
152,Good rooms
153,It was a nice atmosphere and the rooms were nice
154,"Room with a view and gadgets, pool-area and decorations in the hotel."

157,"The place, room, and staff are really amazing"
158,Location and hotel style
159,"Awesome location and the the room is spacious. Awesome city facing view and the bathroom is huge. Overall, room is comfortable and cozy and feel luxurious. Price of room is reasonable for the comfort. Hotel is beautiful with its lobby decoration, with good rating restaurants of different variety. The in-house show is also award winning and worth watching. Hotel has a huge casino and a range of in-house stores. 
Room attendant is friendly, responsive and fast in helping with issues/requests which i'm really appreciative of. Have yet to explore all amendities. Will be back again. 
Location is near both The Strip and Downtown area, making it convenient to explore Vegas."

of one right now."
202,I loved how helpful and cheerful the staff was in every way.  Even when we had a mishap with the booking agency regarding our booking dates. They helped us resolve the mishap quickly and took full responsibility and forward action to make sure we had a room for the night.  The best one at that.  The staff was so helpful and when we had some free time to scout other rooms they offered they immediately had a staff member give us a tour of the available rooms.
