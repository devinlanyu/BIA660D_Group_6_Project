rooms were spacious, comfortable. plenty of room for 3 of us. double vanity bathroom sink a plus. could probably use another outlet in bathroom, but we loved the view (overlooking Bellagio fountains, Eiffel Tower and strip).
The only downer was price of drinks at the pool. 3 drinks (with tax and tip) came to $96.  they definitely weren't worth that."
2,"눇
the room it self was great - clean and comfortable. It was a bait and switch - had to pay extra , hotel blamed it on Booking.com. But never had these problems before with Booking.com, which we have used many times in the last 10 years."

Plenty of room in the bathroom ( tub, toilets, sinks and shower). Loved the soaker tub! Plenty of choices to eat! There was a buffet, plenty of fast food choices, and nice to high end restaurants.  Disappointed with the miniature chocolate lava cake at the buffet. It did not lava!!  Loved the shrimp and grits and the Mac and cheese though! The ribeye steak at Gordon Ramsey’s Pub and Grill did not meet expectations. The two desserts there was great though. The best reason to go was the Reba / Brooks and Dunn concert!!! It was great!!!"

43,"눇
The stay was amazing, this is such an important place for Vegas loving people that it really requires no intros. It meets all expectations for 4 stars and it’s thus not cheap, but splurging some bucks on it feels such a guilty pleasure it’s awesome. Stayed in the Forum Tower, in the spirit of democracy."

The room was large, comfortable & spotless. The bathroom was huge and the soaking tub was like a hot tub. The food at Beijing Noodle was very good as was the Gordon Ramsey Pub.

78,"눇
No amenities provided inside the room like coffee maker, coffee,etc, water, microwave,, for a property that charges arm and leg, its a poor comparison to a Marriott hotel ,, its being well known does not justify the discomfort a family endures just to get coffee in the morning"

I lost my credit card and it was quickly recovered by security. Room was comfortable. Lousy view, but that was to be expected for the price paid. Celine Dione was fantastic!"

I loved that Caesers is close to the Linq Promanade, & close to everything else on the Strip.  The food at the food court is awesome, and we also dined at some of the restaurants on property which are all world class.  My favorite part about Caesers is the Montecristo Cigar Lounge.  My wife’s favorite was the Qua Spa. Great resort with 5 Star amenities and service."

Caesar’s Palace is an icon. Valet parking is easy (USD 20 per night) and quite fast for how huge the property is, our room was a great size with lovely furnishings, the pool area is beautiful. It’s in a perfectly central position on the strip. The enormous spa bath in our room was a great way to relax after a day of walking around."

After staying at the Cosmo for many years and not being happy with their service we wanted to explore a few new hotels. After a great visit at the Bellagio a few months prior we wanted a similar experience but with a younger feeling pool and we found it with Ceasars. Like the Cosmo there are a number of impressive venues and restaurants inside. We loved the room in the new tower which was very quiet with a great view of the pool. We absolutely loved the pool which included a great swim up Black jack table. Only complaint is the bed which was very soft and hurt my back. The bathrooms were gorgeous and we loved the restaurants and had only one bad experience at the champagne bar Fizz which is a rip off and not impressive. I would recommend the hotel if you have a strong back. I am hoping that one of the other towers may have better beds. Most impressive is the easy check in and check out process with machines and Staff that are ready to help the minute you walk in. Great location as well!"

Our room was amazing - we had a Palace king room with an unexpected Jacuzzi bath. The bed was huge and comfy and the the shower and bath facilities were second to none (with two sinks).  We had checked in early but our room wasn't ready but the staff quickly arranged a new and better room for us."

ON ARRIVAL THEY SAID THAT THE ROOM THAT WE HAD BOOKED WAS NOT THE BEST AND STATED THAT FOR AN ADDITIONAL 30 DOLLARS PER NIGHT PER ROOM WE COULD UPGRADE TO A ROOM IN THE OCTAVIA TOWER - WHICH WAS VERY NICE BUT HAD NO COMPLIMENTARY TEA OR COFFEE - YOU HAD TO BUY IT 13.95 DOLLARS!!! NO COMPLIMENTARY BISCUITS EITHER AS IN OTHER HOTELS - HAD TO GO DOWN TO THE COFFEE SHOP IN THE MORNING AND STAND IN A LONG QUEUE."

Upgraded by Jerome (1st day on the job) as we were celebrating our 60th Wedding Anniversary.

Love the Caesars Pools! Also love the selection of restaurants. Cleaner than much of Vegas. Highly recommend Octavius tower. Huge room and wonderful bathtub"
143,"눇
The Room was large and all was good although hotel charged for everything.  Many hotels offer free water and free hot water and coffee etc but nothing with Ceasers.  I think they would have billed me for charging my phone if they could work out how to do it."

luxury property , wouldn't stop there again everything is extra personally thought the pool area was poor charging for sun loungers at the side of the pool  , coffee machine in room with no coffee ,don't even pick any drink out of the mini bar and put back you will get charged , personally felt they were trying to squeeze every last dollar from me , stop in 3stars in vegas before a few times never an issue , we had a twenty dollar breakfast voucher every morning 2 coffees and its gone , apart from all this rooms beautifull"

This iconic hotel is a great place to stay in Vegas. Being central on the Las Vegas Strip makes it a great base for exploring the highlights of the city.

Amazing from the first time you enter the spectacular lobby. Lots of choices to eat and drink - the Bacchanal Buffet was incredible, not cheap but the food was an incredibly high standard, limitless king crab legs, Chinese, Mexican, American, Italian etc etc. The forum shops were lovely to walk around and included lots of dining options too - we had happy hour at the Trevi restaurant bar a few times, $4 frozen Bellinis between 4-6pm and the Cheesecake Factory was always busy. Free drinks whilst having a flutter on the roulette wheel was great. The hotel is also on a huge plot in the middle of the strip so easy access to everything else especially if you use the Deuce bus, $8 for a 24 hour ticket. You could stay here and not come out for a week though!"

At first we given a room in the Palace Tower and it was fantastic.  Beautiful view of the pools.  The bathroom was awesome.  It had two bathrooms.  One side had a toilet and sink and the other had a bathtub, toilet sink and the shower connected the two bathrooms.  The shower had two shower heads so that my husband and I could shower at the same time.  There was a lovely sitting area with a couch and chair.  Very pretty room.  On our 2nd morning, we were woken by construction going on in the room above at 6:00 am.  They were working right above our bed.  It sounded like they were going to come right through the ceiling.  We contacted the Front Desk and they moved us to the Augustus Tower.  We were told that this Tower was completely renovated and the room would be an improvement from what we had.  The room did not have the wonderful bathroom that we had and the view was of the roof tops.  The only thing I liked about the room was that the bed was far more comfortable.  We saw the show Absinthe which is in a Tent on the Caesars property.  Loved it!!  Not a bad seat in the house.  Super nice Staff at Caesars.  We also used the Gym and it was fantastic.  Loved the equipment and the space."

Absolute luxury. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. Stay in Octavia tower, it has been recently renovated and overlooks the pool. Watch the mini bar and snack bar in the rooms, they are fully computerised so if you move an item (or replace the drinks in the fridge with your own) it will record it as a purchase. The buffet is a must do for breakfast or dinner."

4pm was the normal check in time and we tried to check in early but they would charge us $30 to check in early.  So we upgraded our room for $30 which we could check into immediately.  The rooms in the Augustus tower are as nice as the nicest on the strip.  The Beds may be the nicest on the strip.  You can beat location and proximity to everything.  Would absolutely stay here again.
