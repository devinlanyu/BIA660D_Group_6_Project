1,"This is not 5 stars hotel. Don’t even think about staying there. We arrived with my wife at 3 pm, they didn’t give us the upgrade,because the hotel was full.  The room was at 15 floor. Downstairs it was loud disco, we called the reception and asked when the music will stop. They told us no worries, it will close at 6pm. The view from our room was horrible - huge parking and the construction area. When we came back to our room at 1.10 am. The disco was still on and the music was really loud. We called the reception. They apologized and moved us to another room - at 2 am we had to pack our staff again. Another room was also loud and uncomfortable, impossible to sleep and relax. Also the staff in the casino is very unfriendly. The restaurant had a huge waiting line (1 hour approximately) so we went to eat in the shopping center."
2,nothing-it was a bit pricey!
3,We had a strip view on 22 floor and it was noisy till 330am. (Thumping music) Next time we would request a golf course view to eliminate some of the loud music noise.
4,Cocktail service was a little slow at times in the lounges downstairs.
5,"Not the best location since it's towards the end of the strip. You can find well located hotels, with same pros but yet more modern for much a better price -Cosmopolitan, Aria, etc. Didn't stayed on those, but visited them and they are cooler -maybe better taste. If I would had to go again. I would choose a room at a high floor of the Cosmopolitan overlooking the Bellagio fountain."
6,"Resort Tax every day and the different room rates as I was booked in for 7 nights, expected room rate to be the same,"
7,There were no slippers in the room I stayed in (the cheapest kind) but it wasn't a big deal. I also missed having a kettle as I was having a bit of a cold but I know it's not Las Vegas style.
8,The check in was a car crash. Made all the notes while booking about room and beds and yet NONE of it was noticed. Had to end up upgrading and spend hundreds more. Front Desk Manager needs some training.
9,"Horrible staff. I had a problem with their security. 
Absolutely awful awful awful 
Sub par at best"
10,"Was told my room was put on a rush for check in and it wasn't ready until 5:30. Told my room key was tied to self parking and it was not. After waiting all day for a room it was dirty when I got up to it. Don't use the do not disturb, it is obviously there for no reason. The hotel knocked on my door and also called my room while I was trying to rest. I have been to this hotel in the past and received great service, however, this trip did not live up to that. Staff seemed preoccupied with personal things versus the customer."
11,"Smell of smoke in my room was unbearable (it was a non-smoking room), when I asked to move I was offered a complimentary bowl of fruit and that was it. Other than that there were no standout features and the location seemed to be at one end of the strip rather than central."
12,I liked just about everything. I just didn't LOVE anything (except the bath robe. I bought one in the shop downstairs. The best bathrobe ever.) It was impersonal and glossy but uninteresting. I was expecting more from a place like the Wynn especially the weekend before Christmas. It seems to have zero mojo...
13,Nil
14,Not one thing - wish I could have won more for our church - we are trying to build and I do wanted to bring back more to help but I did win 400. On slots - good deal - everything was great - my husbands 75 birthday and we had dinner at Sinantra - excellent
15,I was traveling with family and disappointed heavily that we couldn’t dine in NONE of fine dining restaurants! Policy of this hotel with small children PROHIBITED to even enter to the places! Crazy... Totally disappointed and would never recommend to any my friends this place! We posted even in FB to all married couples to avoid this place!!!
16,"It's definitely not worthy of these prices!!! I have no idea how the property got a better rate than Bellagio but as a frequent Vegas traveler, we are very disappointed by the facility in many terms such as hotel comfort, bed comfort, staff, location, amenities.I would never book this hotel ever again!!!"
17,"The staff there can be really unhelpful sometimes. The the tipping part, if you don't tip them ( Bell Boy or waiters) a very decent amount they give you the worst service next time you visit the bar/resto. Over priced Food. The resort fee is something also not worth especially after your paying a bomb for the rooms. No coffee machine in the room."
18,"Over priced, the tower suit is the same as the regular room the only difference is the view and one has double bed and the other has 2 twin bed.
My experience with the front desk when i checked in was bad as the lady was very rude and didn’t greet me or smiled.
My experience in Tableau restaurant was bad as it started with a stinky fork then it ended up with a hair in my pan cake plate. The waiter didn’t apologize or made any effort to make it up to us. 
My experience the third day in Tableau was also bad as the front desk of the restaurant told us to go for breakfast in Le jardin so we went all tge way from le Tableau to Le Jardin with my 2 children who were so hungry. When we reached there they told us the breakfast is in La Terrase.... o we had to go all the way back there. They were fully booked so we ended up with no breakfast as we had to checkout and leave.... 
I also saw ignorance from the front desk of the tower suite concierge as i complained about the hair and the fork and he said that he will get back to me but didn’t. 
Overall, I found that the hotel look amazing but the service is very bad.
Regards,
May"
19,Paying for parking. There needed to be pillows for those who don't want bulky pillows. Noisy toilet. Poor shower design (shower doors should open the opposite way and there isn't sufficient room to stand because of the shower seat). No movies are provided without paying for them.
20,There was nothing we didn't like
21,walking though smoky casino area to get to guest rooms
22,Wish we didn’t have to pay a resort fee oh $39:00 per day. Received nothing for the money. Never used any services.
23,Could have done without the huge buffet queue for breakfast so we gave that a miss and went elsewhere or ordered room service which was excellent and quick.
24,"6 to 5 odds on blackjack tables. Being steered towards those instead of the 3 to 2 odds, despite being a high roller. Doesn't feel like a gamblers casino. Feels more like a nice vacation spot (which isn't necessarily a bad thing)."
25,Can't think of anything
26,Couldn't find fresh fruit as a breakfast option. I wanted something like Muesli/porridge/fruit.
27,"The extras were expensive - add on a “resort fee” to even get wifi, minibar very pricey, not even a kettle in the room so you would have to pay for tea or coffee. Add tips to everything as well."
28,"Only a couple of gripes, paid 50% extra for quick laundry and was late, found the parasol down bar service to be slow."
29,We had a problem when we got in. The reservation and the credit card and we did not receive a good welcome. The rooms you booked with booking typically are the worst when the hotel assign you the room. They gave us in the lowest floor with rhe view of the air conditioning machines that were working 24hs. The hotel is great but not as expected. Next time will book directly to get a better room and treatment.
30,We love everything in this Hotel.
31,We were turned away from the wing lei ( Chinese restaurant because of our shoes which were 700$ Margiela open toe shoes!!( we were certainly the best dressed people in there!) we wore long pants and collard shirts as we were told...even though at the front table was a guy with an old tee shirt
32,Nothing
33,"- There are no slippers or anything else in the rooms.
- Check-in is dead slow.
- They said the wifi is free but they try to take 19.99 USD per day when we check-out."
34,"Smoke in casino.
Cosmopolitan had a nicer smell.
It was a little expensive with the exchange on the Canadian dollar"
35,The Casino was a bit small I think. The more expensive resturants are not as good as they are pricey so disappointed from the 'Country Club' and that the hotel's bistro was booked for a few nights in advance
36,The booking price was not accurate (booking.com issue) as the weekend rate was much higher than what was displayed online at time of making the reservation.
37,"Smoking in casino area.  Not pleasant if you are a non smoker, even walking through the casino made you smell of cigarette (cigar) smoke. No non smoking area around the pool."
38,About 80% of staff we encountered were not very helpful and different teams seemed like they were working for different companies. No cohesion between front desk and concierge for instance. I was highly recommended the Wynn by discerning friends but the overall service let us down quite badly.
39,The resort  fee should be included in the basic price and not as an add on. Iknew about the resort fee fee when booking but it just seems a good excuse to get more money out of the guest.
40,"The only thing I disliked was the cost of the hotel bar. For example, we ordered two Pina Colada cocktails and a tray of nachos and it came to $69USD. There was free water on-hand, but you could literally spend hundreds of dollars just on normal food and drink if you didn't keep tabs on things."
41,"Had a problem on arrival because after a 10 hour flight and period getting car hire we were very tired and needed a good nights sleep but the only room they had was one over the night club and we were kept awake with the noise.  They did offer a room in the Encore but that was $85 extra.  In the end we complained and they moved us to another room for the next 2 nights and discounted the price for the first night.
We also felt that the prices of food and drink was very high in this hotel"
42,I have one thing to say about getting in and out the front entrance way too many taxi cars and they block the area so you can't get out to the street.they should let one or two cars in at a time in such a small area
43,"- At the end of our stay, one of the bellboys kept saying 'remember ladies, you will not see me downstairs' to push us to tip him as he got our luggage out of the room
- Expensive food and beverages in pool area"
44,Smoking is allowed. So many smoked so couldn't go downstairs for long. Pool could have been a lot better
45,"Ordered 2 cups of tea to the room and this cost 35 dollars. Tea and Coffee is normally a complimentry service in hotel rooms. When we checked in it was very busy and found the staff to be quite short with us. It was a shame because when we walked in we were amazed by how beautiful the hotel was, but then to be greeted by a less than happy member of staff ruined our mood a little."
46,The additional fees you pay when you checkout should be informed and be clear in advance before the booking. All fees + taxes increase the overall bill in more than 20%.
47,No preferential treatment or discounted entry  to XS or Surrender / Encore Beach Clubs
48,I can't of anything.
49,"Though they secured the incentives on a credit card, they kept charging the credit card without our permission."
50,"Everything is bad, rooms are noisy, you can hear thr neighbor, I couldn't sleep. Front desk is disaster. I will never come back"
51,"Allergro Italian restaurant,this was the worst meal we had in our five day stay."
52,The only downfall is it is not in the centre of the strip but this would not deter me from staying her the beautiful hotel outweighed this
53,I came in late and called from Denver airport as my flight kept getting pushed back by United due to a ground delay at McCarren (6 Hrs.).  I got to the hotel at 2 AM the next day. I was charged as a NS on my bill.  It took a manager to correct this at the end of my stay.  It should have never been on my invoice. The auto sheers and drapes did not work in my room and was never addressed during my stay.
54,"First of all we had booked two rooms Wynn for 3 nights, when we arrived they did not have rooms available so after waiting for an hour they gave us rooms in Encore, the next door associate hotel. Next day they informed us at around mid day that they now have one room available in Wynn so we have to shift one room to Wynn, which was through inside walk 15 minutes away, as both of these hotel are huge. When we shifted we could not believe how ridiculous that was, when we were in Encore and our children were 15 minutes walk away. After one hour when we were leaving for Grand Canyon we were told that now they have another room available in Wynn so we should shift their as well. I do not understand what they were thinking that we are all the time packed up ready to move and we were in Las Vegas just to sit inside our room. Since we had to leave so we left for Grand Canyon and they told us that we can stay one room in Encore and one room in Wynn."
55,"It is clear that the focus was not on the swimming/standing (too shallow to swim) pool area when designing the hotel, bit of sad for such a high end place. Also closed after 7pm (the best hours as too hot during the day) as that is not the place where the money is made (exact words from the reception)."
56,My booking was messed up and I got double charged. Problem solved after we left the hotel
57,"Representative at check in was convincing us to upgrade the room to one in the encore with 85$ more, as making us belive it's an upgrade. 
We've arrived to the upgrated room, after a long walk, with no assistance fron staff at all.
While we were trying to understand what we've paid for, we figure out it was all a lie and except of giving us the opportunity to pay more, we actually paid for nothing! 
The buffet that was promised is on extra charge, the pool were closed, the valet was extra charge etc.
We cancelled and back to the original room we've ordered.
There, we didn't receive minibars as promised, there wasn't wifi (really?! In 2017 it's a shame)
We ask for spoons, the representative wanted to charge us for 8$! 
No one even tried to explain us what are the fees we paid for includes. 
Not to mention the alarm that start woorking in 3:30 am for few minutes without any explaination. 
Very bad experience. 
We won't back for sure."
58,Ridiculous 40$/day charge in addition to room price for 'hotel services' which is basically  standard Wifi and facilities access
59,Staff helpful but not very friendly. Food is expensive at all restaurant outlets.
60,Reservations was unsatisfactory.  I booked a king non-smoking deluxe. They had only smoking King deluxe gave me an option to downgrade my room or stay in a smoking room. Said smoking was a request not a requirement. They downgraded my room without any kind of compensation.
61,"Amenity fairs and parking add quite a bit of expenses in the end
Pool area with a lot of reserved sunbeds which were all empty and the rest was quite crowded"
62,"In room snack expiring date was over a year ago. When I informed the reception, I was told that this is unacceptable for them, however no action was taken. No coffee maker in the room. Not even complimentary bottle of water. Pool restaurant waitress refused to serve at the table stating that this is a self serve table. Earlier the same day, another waitress served at me at the same table without any problems. I stayed in Bellagio previously and I must say, on my next trip, I will definitely choose Bellagio again over Wynn"
63,"I hated that we had to wait nearly 4 hours to get into the room and couldn't use any facility's as u needed to be checked in, and we had just done a 24 hour flight to get there"
64,The room service took a lot of time. Like more than an hour.
65,"I was in the 57th floor and I could easily hear the beach party loud music.
No tea or coffee maker
No complementary water 
No complementary internet Wifi 
25 minutes walk from the prime location area of Las Vegas blvd."
66,"Had an issue with the smell of marijuana in the hall I was staying in. However management was informed, dealt with it and offered me a free upgrade on my next stay!!"
67,"No tea or coffee making facilities
Was on non smoking floor but like everywhere in Las Vegas, smoking is far from outlawed yet!"
68,"I could not get my invoice as in my requested title after I left the hotel. It took me about 20 days to ask booking.com for help to get the hotel to send me a invoice as in my requested title because my company need to put it in our accouting records. However, the hotel could not do it."
69,"Massively underwhelming, just a long list of things to sour the experience:
- Super slow checkin
- Dirty room, strongly smelling of smoke
- Loud music from the clubs audible on the 18th floor at 2am
- $40 hidden resort fee, everything was a nickel and dime experience actually
- $20 for a Bombay Sapphire whilst playing a game at the bar
- Machine broke, took 20 mins for an attendant, meanwhile drink was finished
I just wouldn't pay the money again, I'd go elsewhere where they live up to the expectations."
70,"check-in took a while - you have to find the right desk, the guy taking care of the luggage when you arrive early - given the price a would a expect a one stop and quick service. As we arrived early the room wasn't ready. Staff said they will do their best to make it available rapidly and send a text message when ready... we never got this SMS.
Pool closes at 7... pushing people to spend money in the casino. 
Price of water in the room is ridiculous. Not ideal with kids as many areas are not acessible for them."
71,"Very noisy room, very bad services. Does not fulfill the expectation of a 5 star hotel. The hotel wanted to charge me an extra 100+ dollar just because I used the fridge!! Everything that should be free is charged money! Wifi, breakfast, TV, etc. Valet cost me 18 dollars and they did not even park the car at the entrance when I left. I took my cabbages and walked 2 minutes to my car! Very very bad, worst experience ever！"
72,The extra charges on top of booking.com price. It was an extra £65 per night on top of an already expensive hotel. I knew it would be more but would have appreciated an idea on how much more.
73,"The staff at XS is terrible .We spent 7k dollars and our waitress was unprofessional. The managers were incompetent and the bouncers were looking for "" trouble"". If I was traveling with my friends from Cleary Square instead of family it would have been a totally different ending to the night. I can say with unequivocal conviction that I will never step into the Wynn ever again based on the staff at XS."
74,I didn't like that you have to pay to use the spa showers even if you are a guest of the hotel. Our flight is late and no late check out available and we were thinking about using the pool to pass time and then shower but you have to pay to shower :/
75,I felt a bit of discrimination when asked for my room key on my way in Friday night 7/13 and noticed that no one else was asked to confirm their stay
76,"Location isn't the closest to the strip
Refrigerator cooling is extra 25$"
77,"I ordered room service - specified room service for two, but they only brought service for one. The food itself was great though. 
Also, beware of room placement-we were originally on a lower floor right above the night club, I wanted a bit of a quieter room so  they moved us to a higher floor but there was an upcharge for the move."
78,The smoking on the property. I wish Vegas would go smoke-free.
79,"The staff in each encounter was rude and entitled. I have stayed here 2
times before and will never go back. Stay at the Bellagio or Venetian."
80,"A abominal wait for check in, excessive charge for internet and tel even if didn't use, NO COFFEE IN ROOM!,Threat if you use room refrig for anything besides their overpriced stuff they'd confiscate it and charge you a $25 restocking fee, bottled water $10, travelled the World over and never paid so much for so little"
81,Nothing. It was perfection.
82,$150 deposit in advance and high prizes even with great deals from other resorts around. Not a competitive prize for sure.
83,"The beach club was very loud until 2am. I was not able to fall asleep on the 17th floor. If you like it quiet, ask for higher floors, or away from the noise"
84,"Valet was rude and didn't even help us when we pulled up to the room.
Room didn't have slippers for comfort.
Bath tub was dirty and contained hairs from previous guests. Room was a litttle dusty, my sister has eczema so this was very apparent to her."
85,"I'm so disappointed with my stay at the Wynn. Ate the Buffet for dinner, probably my mistake but they advertise it as an excellent restaurant! The selection of food was beyond average not what you would expect here, especially with such high prices for everything. The 2 choices of meat they offer, were low grade cuts, nothing but fat and completely unchewable! The latke station that looked pretty good but unfortunately they are pre-mixed with onions, to which I'm allergic and the guy wouldn't make a small batch for me without, unfortunately. They offer shrimp and crab legs, not the best I've had but decent. The oysters were completely spoiled and when we told the manager, he simply offered to take them back and let his chef know. Thanks to them, I spent my anniversary celebration in the bathroom of my room, all night! I called the restaurant in the morning to let them know that we both got sick and spent the night throwing up and with diarrhea and the manager Brenda, said that they would send security to my room to take my statement and make a report. No where in our conversation did I hear concern or an apology. I felt like I'm being punished for getting sick from their poor choices of serving food that is not fresh! The ""dream beds"" were not that dreamy either, it was kind of lumpy. Made it out to the pool to relax a bit and get some fresh air, and was told by the attendant that I can not have an umbrella, those seats are reserved. I never did see the people show up for those reserved seats, they were vacant the whole time we were there. I'm paying a resort fee, from past experience in other 5 star hotels that includes an umbrella if I need one. To say the least, the service at this hotel does not live up to the hype! I'm very disappointed all around and unfortunately this trip completely ruined my anniversary celebration. Suffice it to say that I won't be coming back here."
86,No free bottle of water in the room like you find in any other city in 4 or 5* hotels. Everything is overpriced so be ready for that and the staff could be friendlier.
87,Never ever!
88,"You need to pay to use the hotel facilities such as sauna and jacuzzi, etc.
Hotel guests didn't receive any privileges to access Encore Beach Club..."
89,"No coffee machine, not close to the main Street and they charged me for the internet."
90,"Just a pleasure to be in,pool area fabulous & that burger with bacon at the terrace bar as a final treat amazin"
91,"It's a 5 star Wynn, I struggle to think of anything to be honest."
92,"A hotel in this category soul at least provide water with out a cost, drinks can be free at the casino but what about water in the room."
93,"Quite pricey when you add the resort fee etc., but that is the same for all hotels on the strip"
94,Hotel took money for rooms twice ! One room used less than 3 hours and another one less than 9 hours  but hotel took money for two nights for each room and didn't return in despite of all supporting documents proofing we stay next night in another hotel more than 400 miles away!
95,We didnt take mini bar but they charged it. They took it out at the end which is nice. I believe the sensor is too sensitive which is annoying
96,"We went to the pool bar one afternoon but it was difficult to find somewhere comfortable to sit.  A major golf tournament was on the TV, meaning a lot of noise that side of the bar.  We went the other side but the comfortable lounge seating was occupied by two guys with ENORMOUS cigars that stank!  They looked and smelt ridiculous and one of them kept spitting in the ashtray. Not my idea of luxurious indulgence!  So we sat at the bar and had a disappointing Margarita - too bland."
97,Staff wasn't really friendly. We reported we lost a pair of socks to the receptionist during checkout and they act indifferently and just shrugged it off.
98,I really don't like the fact you have dogs (who clearly ARE NOT assisted dogs) In the property. I love dogs but it's no environment (a smoke filled casino Vegas!) for them ESPECIALLY when they are around the pool in 30 degree heat with owners who are too busy getting drunk instead of making sure the dogs have water and shade. I am thoroughly disappointed with the Wynn and their lack of responsibility. The reason I picked this hotel is because I'm vegan (and have been to the restaurants many times) and enjoy the vegan options. VERY INCONGRUENT. Steve Wynn (who is began himself I believe)really needs to address this. I appreciate there is a rule for 'emotional support dogs' but the hotel can make it their policy to say No dogs at all.
99,"Service in bar, restaurants terrible. Food came out cold, waited 20 mins to get coffee/be greeted at breakfast. No cocktail waitresses while gambling."
100,"Both Wynn/Encore are a 20 min walk from the south blvd where the Bellagio, planet hollywood etc are."
101,"I wish I didn't have to take my ID everywhere inside the resort to buy myself any drink, containing alcohol, but this is understandable. However, I didn't quite understood the policy about showing ID for payments with credit card at shops. For instance, they don't allow you to pay without ID, but they allow to use any ATM to get cash and pay by cash. From my personal point of view, there is no additional protection, but only inconvenience, because I don't like to carry my documents around."
102,Na
103,It's a pity that there wasn't a coffee maker  in the room and no refrigerator. We feel a refrigerator in our room is a necessity especially in such a hot climate as Vegas. We had to keep running back and forth to the ice machine which was very inconvenient.
104,"There were so many extras costs that came up later, as well VIP access areas which you pay more for. The room rate isn't the final cost if you are international traveller do your sums and even call the hotel to get the rates directly from them. We had a beautiful room but only because we shared the costs between 4 guests. Very pricey spot"
105,"Beware, even though your confirmation might state you have a room with a king sized bed room, they will think nothing of substituting a room with two doubles in its place with no compensation. I had confirmation for two King rooms but both were substituted for doubles on arrival. The only way I could get a room with a King bed was to pay for an upgrade to a Tower suite."
106,The  drinks and snack dispensers are loaded electronically so that even if you pick them up to look there is the chance of a charge.......pretty silly.
107,"A sercurity staff member greeted and treated respectfully other white (Anglo) patrons as they passed to take the elevator to their rooms. He smiled and greeted them. However, as my wife and I (Latinos) walked by him, the white security member, immediately demanded to see my room card. He did it with such rudeness that I immediately concluded he was racially profiling my wife and me. He did not question other white patrons, only us. This happened at about 9 pm in the elevator foyer that leads to my room: 1231, on March 30th. Extremely disappointing and humiliating experience."
108,- quite expensive :(
109,Other than some of the guests nothing at all was a problem.. I slept like a 👶 baby
110,The fitness center at the hotel is  poor and way too small in comparison to the size of the hotel.
111,"the check in.
they claimed twice that there is not any booking even that i showed them your confirmation . they ask me to proof it and call booking com instead of doing it by themselves.
it was really a shame and and waste of time."
112,Smoking around the casino was unbearable.. made me and my girlfriend sick and couldn't even play on the machines. It sucks because you have to  go through the casino to get to your room. Their should be a separate casino areas for smokers
113,We could not get a late check-out :(
114,"My friend and I are 26 and 21, but when we went into the casino part of the hotel we were carded every 7 mins. There were other young looking people there and I did not see the staff carding them excessively."
115,My room was still being cleaned at time of checkin and I got two strange random calls as some as I arrived in the room.
116,"Misled at check in. Upgraded to large suite without fully understanding room upgrade charge. Didn't need suite and cost turned out to be over double.  Credit was given at check out, but was disappointing, very much felt misled."
117,"Unpleasant aspects:
No fridge/coffee making 
Need to go to line up in the cafe to get morning coffee.
No room in the minibar fridge for any of  your own items. A sign threatens to charge you if you displace a minibar item for more than 30 seconds.
Very hard to find way around or out of the facility. Almost as if you are trapped in the casino area.
We were in Las Vegas for a conference, not to gamble.
Food in restaurants/ cafes is overpriced and mediocre."
118,"TV guide listed only channels and not the programming, so I had to channel surf like I was in the 80s.  I know this is nitpicking, but being the only thing I didn't like while being in the room I guess it stood out.  Hey, you spoiled me Wynn so now I expect more ;-)"
119,"No coffe machine in the room, no complemnary water, there was not available place to put any thing in the fridge."
120,"The breakfast included in the Tower Suites rate was no more than ok (one course plus tea/coffee and water, no juice), though a la carte was available. Beer selection in bars didn't really embrace the burgeoning craft beer scene, with just a couple of choices in each amid the ubiquitous bigger brands."
121,The front desk did not help me at all I had to go through booking.com and start a claim
122,"Low efficient customer service, lobby manager was very racist, selective and arrogant. You cannot use their fridge at all otherwise will incur surchage no matter what. No extra facility is available i.e. water, ice, vending machine and etc. The hotel rooms are located within the casino and smoke is allowed in this area, therefore you will have to suffer all these unpleasant experience on a daily basis."
123,Nothing bad to say
124,"The gentleman that checked us upgraded us to two bed room at a charge of $50 per night,  even though I already paid for the extra person through booking.com. I tried to explain that at check out, and the manager was so extremely rude to myself and my family when we were letting her know what happened. She refused to refund the uparade fee, and walked away when we were inquiring about the fee. It was the WORST customer service experience I have ever had. I will not be staying here again upon any of my future visits to Las Vegas."
125,"it was my first time staying at the wynn, and hearing all about it i was excited. the experience itself was good. upon checking out i realized i was charged for petty things, (a resort fee, which a lot of other hotels charge too, wifi, gym etc). also, if you sign up for wynn's emails, you will find way better prices. i stayed here for NYE and paid close to 1500usd more than i should have (i booked 2 rooms for 3 nights). also, walking back to the end of the strip, when the streets were closed was a pain, but i guess that's my fault for wearing 4 inch heels."
126,The pricing for water or cofee was too much. And the ladies with alcohol service were not going around much.
127,"Upon check in they said that they didn't have the room type available that we had booked so offered an upgrade..but this was a room at the wynn encore which isn't quite as good as the Wynn - we didn't want to stay at the encore so asked them to honour the room that we had booked , the only option that they would offer was then either a downgrade or paid upgrade . We opted for the latter and the tower suite rooms at an extra $60 per night were worth it but it's annoying none the less especially after our room was booked months before travel and we were tired at the end of a long flight"
128,Not applicable.
129,"In the room, the light setting for low light left too many lights on, and wasn't effective (too bright) for low evening light. Not a big issue."
130,Some of the staff could be better informed on comps and other promos available to guests.
131,"Only gym
Gym manger Lindsay was terrible 
Bad attitude"
132,Staff behavior was terrible. He knocked the door at 9:24am just to make sure we will leave the room on time- 11:00am- .The valet man didn't explain us we should pay for it but he leads us in valet way at the entrance time and we should pay for it and it was not refundable.
133,I was debited additionally with the wrong amount and the money still were not returned. My advise would be to use separate card with very limited amount of money you plan to spend for this particular hotel
134,"This place is not children friendly. To get to the resort elevator you have to go through the smoky casino area first.  Plus, we were asking a non smoking room. The room turns out to be clean and chic, but the room hall way , elevator , and some resting areas have heavy cigarettes smell. 
We are traveling with a toddler , and since most of the restaurants in casino has long line up during the holiday, ( and the higher end restaurants not accepting little kids at all ) we hope to order take out with Wing Lei or Red 8 . None of them accept take out orders as well. It's very confusing for us. We expect a 5 start resort that charge resort fee up to 35 us a day has more choices and flexibility  for family with little kid!"
135,"Didn't know there was a charge to park vallet,should have been told when we parked. And why is there a charge when we were staying at the Wynn why not include that in the price of the stay???? So that part was not good, being penalized for staying at the Wynn!"
136,"The reception did not have my reservation because the name was not correct, after a few moments they found it but I did not have access to the internet for the same reason the first 24 hs
I am a regular guest, at least 2 times a year of the Wynn and is the first time they do not made me feel at home"
137,No bellman and had to carry our own bags over the length of a football field. Also paying $40 for two cups of coffee and two muffins from a walk up counter is WAY to much. They also seem to maximize every opportunity to get money out of you. $500 a night and they still monitor if you took the trail mix or water. Penny wise pound foolish. Our last time going to Vegas for we do not gamble.
138,Server at Jardin was scatter brained and ignored our requests or forgot several times. Security staff was not friendly or helpful.
139,internet connection was slow.
140,"Everything in the room is chargeable they don't even offer free water, they have sensors on the mini bar which ha as 30 second rule, if you pick up the item for 30 seconds they charge it to your room .. simply greedy, anything to get your money."
141,"Checking in was an ordeal, took way to long 35 minutes and was not informative. 
Hotel guests should have priority for Buffett Eatery instead of having to wait in an hour plus line"
142,"Staff were terribly rude. We queued for over an hour to check-in, then we got moved to another line and then we got moved back to our original line but told to go at the back! When we tried to explain that we were moved to the back of the line for no reason, the guy yelled at us to go back to where we came from."
143,Nothing
144,WIFI's kinda at a slow speed
145,Housekeeping left the previous guests dirty shirt on the floor as well as the bathroom floor was covered in some previous guests hair.
146,"The breakfast buffet queue was very long, when tables were available, this had the effect they desired, because the next morning we ended up ( just like several others)  paying another $20 to basically queue jump by 40 minutes."
147,The check-in person was trying not to give me my requested room and trying to sell me higher category. You need to revise the bill carefully.
148,The rooms were smokey.
149,It would have been great if our numbers could have come in at the Blackjack table and the winnings had paid for this getaway. Oh well.
150,"As you would expect at a 5 star resort, the prices were ridiculous! One  Coors light beer (in a can) $ 9.00 each. One bagel, plain, toasted $ 11.00 PLUS $ 8.00 room service charge PLUS automatic 18% gratuity for a GRAND TOTAL of $ 19.20."
151,"Vastly overpriced!
Charged for bottles of water in room
No tea/coffee making facilities in room
Room Tax
Resort fee charge PLUS resort fee tax"
152,The pool was frustrating as there was only really one spot where you would get sun all day and the rest of the parts would be a couple of hours.
153,"Our booking reservation was for 3 adults in a room with king bed. However when we arrived at the hotel they told us it was not possible and that the fault is at booking. Com... 
We were left with no other choice but to take a room with 2 queen beds, which was highly uncomfortable. We were expecting a king bed and an additional sofa or roll out bed. At registration we were asked to pay additional 50 dollars for this option, which was unreasonable. 
The staff was unfriendly and our. night and our room were far from expectations."
154,"25 minutes waiting for check in on the first day is not acceptable.  With only six check in agents, and a long line of customers. I missed my dinner reservation because of this long wait.
Coffee machine and bathroom slippers would be nice to add in the rooms."
155,Very slow check in process.  We came at a slow time with only a few people in line but it took 20 min to check in
156,Would have been nice to win at the casino!
157,"Not so good - everything comes with a price and sometimes the price is steep. Rent a minimum cabana - $300 or sit far away mostly in the shade. Spa treatment - $400. Fancy dinner out - $200.  Go to a club - $600 for ""bottle service"" or you can go but not ever sit down for $100.  Really?  This must be how the 1% lives..."
158,"Dreadful queues for the buffet breakfast and they deal with it by adding a $10 premium line, which is mainly empty rather than having two lines and half the wait. That's greedy and stupid. Also generally the prices were idiotic."
159,there was construction outside with drilling that woke us up every morning ..also the night club was so loud and sounding off the buildings waking us up at night. OUr sink clogged twice as well. THis was a VERY expensive property so these things should not happen also the lines for the coffee shop in the morning RIDICULOUS! they need another option
160,"Breakfast-area is too small for too many people, like it is with dinner. It's absurd that you have to wait 40-60 minutes in a long queue when you are in one of the finest and most expensive hotels in Las Vegas. Very poor experience. Stop allowing non-guests to eat in these areas. Also, some employees in the shops are quite grumpy. 
And last but not least: have never seen so many criminal faces in one place, especially in the casino-area."
161,Change the music for the fountains there are only 5 or 6 numbers on a loop
162,"Noise is a real problem depending on the room location. We got a corner room with a great view only to find out on our first night that construction work wakes you up at 6m in the morning (we were on a high floor as well). On the second night, we had the ""pleasure"" of being woken up by the bass music from the club at 2am, and then construction again at 6am. Eventually I had to ask for a room transfer. Having this on 2 out of the 3 night stay certainly dampened the experience. I was initially offered a very small refund and ear plugs (plaster to a broken foot type of fix). After the second night, when they saw how frustrated I was, they decided to deduct one night pay.
Overall, I think the Wynn dealt with the issue in an ok manner (the first offer somewhat insulting) but it does not fix the issue that, at the moment, there is a fundamental noise issue with some of the rooms. I would have thought the welcome desk should have mentioned something about this and was surprised they did not."
163,"There is no coffee machine in the normal room. 
When you finish from the gym and you want to take a shower on the spa you have to pay 40$!"
164,"Hotel rules regarding to the rooms deposit rate. It was very high. 
I booked 3 rooms for one nights , they did not accept the deposit to be cash. They block my card with rooms deposit and the block has been released after 15 days from hotel checkout."
165,No doorman to help with the door or luggage. Checking in took a little too long. Waited almost 20mins. No bottles of water given and no wifi in the room. It just feels like everything additional will be charged. Lack the sense of touch.
166,Very pricey to eat/drink inside the Wynn but wouldn't stop me from coming back. This is the place to stay while in Vegas for sure.
167,"We did not like the fact that they did not let us hang out at encore beach club and sent us back to Wynn pool , and the next day we went to encore pool again and there was no problem . Clearly the girl at the door decided she has an authority to tell us we could not come first time ,and second time the guy was so easy going and welcomed us and said Ed could go and hang out at the island bar or if find seats , may lay out"
168,Everything was excelent .
169,Cigarette smoke...
170,The front desk personnel where rude. It took over 30 minutes to check in. I had a package mailed to the hotel. The sender called and verified how to send the package the hotel returned it to the post office. The room noise was horrible. It took 2 calls to security before the situation was ever addressed at 3am by 5am we could actually sleep. I paid a lot to stay here. From what I could tell there were a lot of twenty somethings piling into one room. I mean like 10 people a room I assume this is the only way they could afford to stay here. Very disappointed in this hotel for the price.
171,The only thing I dislike is the smoke in the casino.  Not too much they can do about that though. Their ventilation system is better than other casinos but still smokey.
172,No coffe machines nor tea
173,"The staff, there is no personal touch, they make you feel uncomfortable. The pool seats are reserved for the cabanas, the quality of the food is very very very bad"
174,"Brunch buffet not so original. I'd avoid it and go somewhere elese.Robotic staff, neutral at best at the stations."
175,"Not aware of the dedicated tower room check in counter (it's not indicated and they don't send email so we had to queue a long while for checking in); ""strip view"" on the 16th floor in the left of the tower is a joke;"
176,"The 5 star hotel do not provide slippers!! And no complementary water
I asked the cleaning lady for slippers and she said they are not provided to guests. When I checked out I expressed that to the deck and they said I should ask for it! 
They charged me 80$ extra for a night due to ""high demand """
177,Cocktails are a little pricey >$20 but the food is reasonable.
178,The pool entry was hard to find.
179,I did not like the service of the waitress at the Allegro restaurant. The waitress took a long time to bring my check despite that I told the waitress that I was in a hurry to go to a show.
180,"They need to sort the process for check in/ out. We were checking out on Sunday morning and it was slightly chaotic, though for check out we did find the rapid check out process which bypassed this, but I felt for those checking in."
181,The alcohol from the mini bar is a bit pricy.
182,"Bed service at the wynn registration.
bell man was terribly late and quite rude."
183,Nah!
184,"Complained of noisey music after 2nd night, until 4am and as far up as the 36th floor.  Requested room change. Staff mentioned a nightclub and it was not open the 3rd night - it was. Complained for a second time on the 4th day. Staff tried to negotiate with me again - lack of sleep and not impressed. Requested a room change - they had one ready that afternoon. Much quieter - bliss. 
Disappointing start to our holiday as we stayed at this hotel last year no problems."
185,"For the price that you pay, there should be a refrigerator and microwave in the rooms without a charge. Everyone may not eat all of his/her food from the day or night before, and he/she needs somewhere to place and warm it."
186,"The room was very dirty on arrival.  There was a breath rite strip stuck to the shower, The floors had not been vacuumed, the dresser had a bunch of trash in it.  The sink ran slow and the bed was lumpy"
187,"Internet that is provided is absolutely awful. Considering the cost of the wifi bundled in the ridiculous ""resort fees"" and the reputation of the Wynn the quality and stability of the wifi was unacceptable. Worst of all the cellphone coverage is dismal at best while in the rooms forcing guests to rely on the wifi which is equally as bad.  Internet access at a Holiday Inn or Motel 6 is light years better."
188,Really... Nothing at all
189,Goodies in the room were on a weight system- so why are they in the room if they're not included with the room rate? Also didn't care for the constant checking of our ID's at every table. It didn't make me feel very welcomed.
190,"As part of the offer in booking through Booking.com we were supposed to receive show tickets, which when we arrived at the hotel we were advised that this was not the case and that the Showstoppers were not performing. Very disappointing as this was one of the reasons why we booked through Booking.com at the Wynn. No alternative was offered and no attempt was made to rectify this."
191,"Charging for wifi in this day and age is like charging extra to switch the lights on. Cheap move. Also, they make you pay hugely for anything not included in the room rate."
192,"Queues for breakfast - restaurant could be bigger, you have to make a reservation for breakfast"
193,Paying for internet and access to fitness room.  No  room in frig for anything but what hotel wanted you to buy.  Concierge was very prompt to supply another refrigerator (at no cost) for diabetic supplies.
194,the reception staff didn't tell us if there will be other taxes and charges. since the hotel have been paid for through booking.com
195,"The staff seemed to have mixed attitudes toward people who book through booking.com though most were polite and attentive.
The adult pool area was like an out of control episode of the Kardashians and the many mirrors in the hotel were often accompanied by heavily made-up/fake tanned people taking pouting selfies.
Fine if that's your scene but it wasn't ours."
196,"Queues for checking in and for buffet. Out of character for a hotel of this supposed quality 
No automatic turndown/ towel change
Everything charged as an extra - wifi, water,"
197,Was in a very noisy room with party people blasting music late into the night. Could even hear it out in the hall when walking towards the room. Repeated calls to ask for room change as I had to get up the next morning at 6:00.
198,Staff! They are not helpful. We wanted a smoking room and room in the upper floors. We have mentioned in our booking reservarion but they give us non smoking room in the floor 5!
199,"The lobby, bars, casino were very smoke filled. Went to other casinos & didn't feel choked. Filter system? The Wynn shops were lovely but super pricey. There are 2 large malls next door & across the street."
200,The staff were very rude. They would open the room door without knocking and would walk in this happened two times in one day . I called management and they said they would look into it but nothing happened.  Not happy at all  .
201,"A coffee pot would have been stellar.  I understand the suites had coffee service in their rooms.  Also, can understand with a corner room there was no place for a couch, but there was no place to relax but the bed."
202,Registration for check in and check out is very disorganized!! Nobody will call you to attend you. We had to ask front desk people who will help us with check in and check out.
203,A/C too cold.  We turned it off.
204,the checking in process was outrageous (1.5 hours)
205,No coffee maker in the room
206,nothing really.  Pool a little crowded but that is the case at every hotel in the summer.
207,"The fridge is full of paid beverages - so no space to put anything else there.
Pay attention to the ""resort fee"" - in my case it was $32 per day and was covering internet, fitness gym and smth else (I only needed internet, but  there was no option to change/cancel this fee). I did not notice this fee when booking a room. If there is not option to cancel that fee - I see no reason for separating it from a room charge."
208,"Really liked the hotel but booking my room through booking.com sucked. I
was there with a group of friends, the rest of them obtained the same
room, on the same dates at half the price (booking through a different
website), it included breakfast and the resort fee for them was
optional. How much more did I end up spending during the same stay? 600+
usd only on those things!!!!! I had always reserved through booking.com.
Not anymore."
209,"No chair or sofa in the room.
No complimentary water! for a family of four this can get annoying having to buy and carry water bottles from outside
No bath slippers in the room, had to ask for them.
No baggage help upon arrival!"
210,The hotel did not accept the rate given by Booking.com..we ended up paying the rate at the hotel which was way higher than the rate given by Booking.com plus extra costs not previously mentioned...
211,I had  six friends that I met out there all had breakfast included and I didn't! 38 dollars for breakfast is very expensive. I only went once to the buffet but it was amazing! Very long queue to get in though.  They persuaded me to upgrade my room once I arrived which wasn't worth doing as my friend who didn't had a better view!
212,My TV was not working and took three engineers to fix it. Also I spent a lot of money at the Casino at the tables and lost probably 8k. Then they said I wasn't eligible for any comps.
213,"Like many Las Vegas top hotels, everything is f*ing expensive. $6 water bottle in the room. $18 per device for WiFi. All hotel restaurants; can barely look at them for less than $35, even for a light breakfast. Casino minimums are way too high (on a good day, BJ min is $15). Pool bar 1 drink+bad sandwich: $40."
214,"Felt overcharged. The hotel was too calculating. Rent your fridge, because it's full of their drinks. No room for your items. They charge you after 30 seconds sensor! Pool closes at 7 early bird. Surprising for las wages. ""Tower Suite"" is not a real suite. It's just a normal room. Beware with your expectations. Beware with inclusive breakfast. Gratuity and additional drinks were confusing. Some say it was included, but still added to the total bill. Annoying surprises."
215,Small complaint only...There was a surprising lack of power outlets in the room. Actually had a difficult time plugging in my cell phone to charge.
216,"The behavior of the staff. We had on our bill the whole minibar and the wrong room rates  (the high price of the day and not the price given by booking com). I have to go back to booking com for the reduction as I have errounsly thrown away the printed confirmation of booking.com and no access to Intetnet at the reception to show the staff the error. And I was in a hurry to get to the airport (did not receive a pre ill in the room). The staff refused to check ! 
I shall even go legally agains Wynn whe"
217,"room service, cleaning service, service efficiency, room hygiene
We stayed for two nights at Wynn Las Vegas. We had always heard good words about the hotel, and we wanted to give it a try on our vacation trip. However, our stay was much worse than our expectations.
We checked in and got into our room late in the evening. The room was really nice, with stunning views of the city in the night. We were happy about the room until we checked our bathroom. There was a wet towel in the bath basin, and the basin was still wet. It was extremely shocking to see a bathroom still dirty and uncleaned at the time of check-in. Even for a standard hotel, this would be a fail mark. The room seemed like someone didn't finish cleaning. There was also no bottled water on the table. We called the front desk about the issue. The lady who answered the phone said that she would notify the cleaning service and ask someone to come up and clean the bathroom. No sincere apologies or solutions to change the room. Because we were tired and wanted to go to bed soon. I asked that if we need to wait for the cleaning person to finish cleaning while we are in the room. She said that I could wait till tomorrow for them to clean. I was like excuse me? So I'll have to use the dirty bathroom in a hotel room that i paid for?
I've stayed in other Vegas hotels and haven't seen any situation like this. In the end, they sent someone to come up to look at our room. A guy came after a while and looked at the bathroom. Then he told me that he was gonna send someone to clean it. We waited again for a cleaning lady to come. She seemed very shocked when seeing the dirty bath basin and said we should definitely talk to someone at the hotel. So we had to wait in our room while the cleaning lady cleaned our bathroom in the middle of night.
I have to say this is one of the most ridiculous experiences I've had staying in hotels."
218,Nothing
219,See above
220,"In our 3 days stay, our room got cleaned only once, and that even was per my request. For Memorial Day weekend there was no difference (in terms of costs) between people who stay At The Wynn and others. XS night club was cramped. At concierge they tried to push us to buy tickets because it could be sold out, but at the event's night they were still selling tickets to the last second. We went out of club just to be able to breath, but when we wanted to come back in they put us back in a 1.5 hours long line, even though we showed stamps on our hand."
221,"I like the rooms. We had a panoramic premium double bed room, it had a gorgeous View. The Encore beach club + Surrender nightclub venue is also amazing. Unlike other clubs, the venue is open and less congested."
222,I don't have anything of I can think of.
223,Didn't win much money!
224,The food at Wing Lei was disappointing.
225,"Paying for WiFi............. 
Queuing at the cafe. Great to have somewhere simple for good coffee and light food but too busy. Would be great to have more cafes, i.e. something a notch down from the full table service restaurants for simple breakfasts or lunches"
226,"Requests...crib, high chair and more took more than one request to obtain....3."
227,"It would have been nice to know the prices of the mini bar fridge and snacks that were available.  It was almost scary to even touch an item for fear you would be charged an extraordinary amount.
I thought the casino was very smoky which I did not enjoy."
228,"There was a terrible hotel empoyee, he was so rude, I asked the direction of check in counter, but he was so rudely said single word, I said thank you, but he said nothing. I felt I was un welcomed. He was black, tall, looks early 30s and stood outside of gambling section. I remember his face of bad expression until now."
229,"Would have been nice to have shower gel in the room .. the really small bar of soap not easy to use. Also, difficult to get seated for breakfast without a long wait (1 1/2 hours). The smoke was pretty strong in the casino and surrounding areas."
230,"The pool closing at 7:00 PM. On hot days, this is the best time to enjoy relaxing in the beautiful pool.  Please consider extending the closing time until 8 or 9 PM as this is the case in many 5star hotels we have been to. The staff had to tell many patrons to start leaving at 6:30 PM, which to us is totally unacceptable. The hotel should present another option for using a pool after 7 PM as it is hard to get back to enjoy after busy days sightseeing and shopping in Las Vegas."
231,"slow check in and check out,slow room service,slow wi-fi in public area and restauranrs,too exprncive wi-fi for bedroom,"
232,No late night eateries only 1 and it was quite expensive !!  Room beautiful but would ask for a better view next time !
233,"Room was nice but not as nice as led to believe from booking advertisement
Passport was stolen so even though they saw it the day before and it was stolen in their casino couldn't be on the main floor after that."
234,"breakfast was not included, queues were everywhere (concierge,food) no one helped us with the baggages"
235,The fact that they couldn't do any alteration on our reservation because we booked through a third party. also the queue to The Buffet was very discouraging
236,Nothing the experience was amazing
237,It is about a 20 minute walk to get to the Bellagio at the center of the strip.
238,"In a city of hotel rooms, one need not distinguish themselves by simply being more expensive. They do a nice job of being a 5 star hotel but there's too much competition out there to charge so much for everything."
239,"Having to pay for WiFi when paying top $ for room is very poor policy.
Door was hard to open.
Toilet didn't flush quietly"
240,"Concierge staffs were not friendly, they never smile. They let you feel that they want you to finish your questions and go!
Bellboy put our luggage (5 large bags) next to our car and he left, he let us deal with it without any help!!!!"

272,Check in was a little slow
273,Why there are no picking service reminding?
274,You are treated like cattle. Room with horrible view:(
275,I thought it was ridiculous that we had to pay and extra $25 to have a refrigerator delivered to the room.  Way too many hidden fees.
276,No tea or coffee in room
277,"I was amazed with the fact that they charged me for the some packages that arrived from Amazon.
I will never go there again"
278,None
279,Can't think of anything important

291,Everything Perfect!
292,Some of the slots I felt were just money eating.
293,Everything was great but the bed was a little uncomfortable.
294,All ok.
295,"That they charged my criedt card by 115 USD without informing me, even though i payed a deposit of 900 USD for any extras."
296,Having to pay for wifi.  One shouldn't have to at this level of hotel.
297,No tea & coffee facilities in room
298,coffee in the room would have been nice
