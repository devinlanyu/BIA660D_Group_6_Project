1,The room was so big and gorgeous.
2,"They have a great staff, lots to do onsite and huge comfy rooms"
3,We loved everything about this hotel!  We plan to stay at the Venecian next time we travel to Las Vegas.  The location of the hotel and all the shopping was fantastic.
4,Front desk agent who checked us in was extremely accommodating. Offered us an upgrade at a discounted rate.
5,"This is the 2nd time I have stayed at this beautiful facility.Beautiful amenities - luxurious bedroom and bathroomBed was wonderful!Separate sitting room with desk area with multiple electrical outletsWi-Fi fast and stable.Front desk staff helpful and welcoming even though I booked through a 3rd party.Bell staff - efficient and timely.Onsite restaurant experience - delicious meals, more affordable than expected."
6,Very nice bedroom
7,Bed was amazing and so comfy!!!! I wish I could bring the bed home with me. The hotel is absolutely worth your penny! Though we only stayed one night but it's the best decision we ever made during our honeymoon trip.
8,Good location Suite was big
9,"Spacious room and bathroom, comfortable beds, helpful staff."
10,"The room up grade to top floor, awesome, beautiful."
11,"When you book a room at the Venetian, you get a suite, in fact every room is a suite and that, makes you feel like money well spent.  I've stayed at the Venetian few times and it never disappoints.  I will come back."
12,The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was excellent
13,The room was incredibly comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful. Restaurants and shops on the property were great. Good location on the Vegas strip.
14,One of the nicest hotels on the strip. Excellent restaurants. Staff were very helpful. Would definitely return to this hotel.
15,"The hotel is over the top. I think it suits couples rather than a group of friends as it's ""trying"" to be very classy and in a romantic style. The casino was great and huge, but very classy and a bit sleepy in oppose to the casino's I've seen in other hotels, which might be a good or bad thing depends on what you're looking for. We've booked a suite with two queen beds, which was ok, but bed should be king size if you're looking for maximum comfort. The bathroom was huge and comfy, this is where I spent most of my evening when got ready to go out."
16,"The suite room was wonderful, like having your own mini apartment in Vegas bar kitchen facilities but who would want to cook with so many great eateries on hand?!The beds (which are very high if you are short!) were exceptionally comfortable. Fabulous tvs in the sunken sitting room, bedroom and even bathroom. The sitting area was very relaxing and large with small dining table and desk. The wired internet was excellent, I didn't even mind having to do some work I had with me in such a lovely environment! Electronic blinds and curtains a great touch to the large picture windowsThe bathroom was exceptional and the most comfortable bath I have ever soaked in (be sure to treat yourself to some bath goodies). Large walk in shower, separate WC and a dedicated hair/make up area and double sinks, in marbleWe had a super view from floor 23 looking out over the strip (Mirage to left and Treasure Island to right and straight through to Red Rock Canyon).The casino is very airy and well laid out.Complimentary wheelchair hire was much appreciated and the hotel was very easy to navigate with a wheelchair.Highly recommend eating at Grand Lux (sister to The Cheesecake Factory)"
17,Love the cleanliness and size of our room. Love crib and little condiments they provide for our baby.
18,Basically everything. Good experience started with the spacious 14 storied car park-Free of charge for hotel guests. This was the first indication that the management consider all guest requirements and every other aspect followed. Checking was in the traditional manner where we were queuing up for registration but it went super-fast. Staff was outstandingly polite and helpful. The hotel is very well secured. Professional security personnel guarantee that only the registered guest get access to residential towers and guest facilities. Remember to have your key card with you. Security will not allow you to reach elevators leading to rooms if you do not have the key in hand. I booked a Luxury Sweet and realized it was fully worth the money the moment I opened the door. The sweet was beyond all my expectations and imaginations and was simply glamorous. You find top notch restaurants in the restaurant row and grand canal shoppe itself is an experience.
19,This place was absolutely amazing! The rooms are gorgeous and everything else is pretty awesome too. We won $4700 on a buffalo machine! What more could we ask for.. this was a luxury place I never thought I would be able to stay in.. I will definitely be back!!
20,"Venetian channel is amazing, especially light. Very nice bed."
21,The room was lovely and spacious.
22,Lobby and the shops/canal
23,"Beautiful rooms and great value for money. Great location - walking distance to shows, good restaurants. How Venice's St Mark's Sq. was replicated was well done. Beautiful hotel and very well maintained."
24,The opulence and size of the room. It was fantastic for a 3 day stay.
25,"Large room, big beds, free parking, fast wifi."
26,Amazing hotel with a fantastic architecture mimicing the Italian style nicely. Very polite and enthusiastic staff. Room size was much bigger than expected with a good view on the St. Mark's Campanile tower and the luxuorious pool downstairs.Had a great time there!
27,"I like Venetian restaurants, the shopping arcade and rooms. They were excellent during check-out and valet parking"
28,Great location. Very spacious rooms
29,"It’s the Venetian, so you have that going on for you! Located in the strip, largest resort, amazing restaurants, shops, etc... And the fitness centre was absolutely AMAZING! 
And the one thing I would say was truly 5* from the Venetian was their customer relationships. As per the rest of our review we were not happy with the stay at all and they contacted us personally to discuss. Considering they have 7000+ rooms, providing personalised customer support shows that they really care about each and all of their customers."
30,"Everything about this property is exquisite.  if you want to be safe, comfortable and relaxed this is the ultimate place to stay.  Everyone is nice and helpful."
31,"spacious room and big , I mean very big bathroom huge lobby a dozen staff at counter for check incasino is busy"
32,Everything!!!!Book this hotel every time for an amazing experience. It will take two days to explore this resort on its own before you head into the Vegas strip. Don't touch the bar fridge bottles as there are sensors under each base that bill you each time ypu lift a bottle even if you put it back immediately. Management were great though and wiped the minibar bill when we explained this to them. No stress with this hotel/casino.
33,A lot of facilities near-by.
34,"Great location, helpful staff and incredible resort. Loved the spacious room!"
35,"Nice room, plenty of amenities. Good spa experience."
36,"The beds were comfortable,  the suite is spacious"
37,"The hotel is fabulous, one of the most beautiful and charming in the whole LV area. We visited some other famous hotels, but liked our the most. The streets of Venice, St. Marco square and the channels with gondolas are breathtaking"
38," the halls and the winter garden are to die for. The hotel has lots of restaurants and shops, thus you can spend 3 days without leaving the perimeter"
39," it is also connected to another hotel Palazzo, with good long walk for exercise. The rooms are spacious, comfortable beds, large bathroom. Heated swimming pool and Jacuzzi in the winter garden in the courtyard (although in open air, thus a bit chilly in winter) is a nice bonus.  Madam Tussauds' museum is somewhat smaller than expected"
40, it is best to buy tickets in the hotel with the discount as compared to much higher price in the museum.  Large parking with plenty of space. Central location with 10 minutes walk from Bellagio and Caesar Palace...
41,Bed was a bit too soft but that's just my opinion.   Beautiful room and bathroom.
42,"I have been to Vegas four times and have stayed at the Venetian twice! The luxury, the amenities and the service is second to none. The staff is amazing, the resort is worth every penny, stay here and never stay anywhere else again! The basic suites are amazing, the bathroom alone is worth it!"
43,Only some sweets and coffee for Breakfast. It's a Grab and Go bag.
44,"The rooms were very comfortable, very big, and clean! The staff was very accommodating and friendly."

73,"Bathroom was great (great water pressure in the shower, love the TV in the bathroom)"
74,The room is nice and big

87, my boyfriend said he felt like he was sleeping on clouds!
88,"1. Beautifully designed room2. A light and bright hotel that made you feel happy, many of the Vegas hotels are very dark and focus too much on casino and not enough on the hotel (New York, New York)3. The hotel and rooms were immaculately clean, credit to the cleaners4. Grande lux cafe by the lift did beautiful food of a good quality5. The canals and shops made it one of the more entertaining hotels to stay at if you are not into a gambling this hotel is the best, also great for kids over 8 as they will enjoy it6. It is indeed a great creation of Venice having been there it captures the romance of the place7 the pools there are 4 to choose from and fabulously heated if you feel the cold8 perfect location"

94,Everything about the Venetian was beyond my expectations.

96,"Venetian is a grand hotel. It is an architectural gem from inside.  The reception, lobby and other common areas are worth seeing. The rooms were spacious and clean. I found their casino to be the most well lit among the other big names. The food court has many food options especially vegetarian ones. The other hotel Palazzo is connected through the food court and shopping area. There are many dining options. Free valet is available for hotel guests which was very good considering parking is a hassle on the strip."
97,"Bouchon Restaurant and Bakery were excellent.  The macaroons are out of this world.  Luxurious features such as chocolates in satin pouches left on pillow.  Bathrooms are large with a separate water closet, makeup table and chair and tv, double sink. Several full length mirrors.  Stand up glass enclosed showers, and tub.  Opulent details such as crown moulding .  Three TV'S. The furniture is upscale looking.  Curtains are electronically raised."

138,"Excellent hotel and facilities.Very disappointed with the Casino staff as we travelled with 4 adults aged 21-23 that were constantly harassed for ID and staff were very rude to them all on too many occasions  to the point where it became VERY embarrassing, DO NOT CHOOSE this hotel resort if you are 21-25 as you will not be welcomed.In addition a large majority of the Casino staff seemed very miserable and it seemed that they did not want to be there.On a positive note, we met and were served by a very pleasant elderly asian lady (her name escapes me, however she served our table near the kitchen entrance at 10.30am on Sat 15/07/17) in the Lux Grand Cafe, maybe the hotel resort should model there staff on this lovely pleasant member of staff who is a credit to their business  ?"
139,"The beds are so comfortable, I did not want to get out of my bed. rooms are fabulous."
140,"The bedding was excellent, I liked the bathroom as well."
141,"We stayed at this hotel as it's iconic to Las Vegas and it did not disappoint.  The decor was over the top extravagant everywhere you looked there was something to see.  The rooms were very large, but reflective of the cost, restaurants were everywhere and they were open all hours.  We left the hotel at 3.30am and it was like it was still midday outside.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  There were shops everywhere but I would recommend saving your money and going to the Northern Outlet Stores instead.  I would recommend this hotel if you want the full LV experience and were not worried about the expense."
142,"Massive hotel with so much to do, upgrade room to suite view it's worth it, rooms are beautiful and food is good"
143,"Luxury of the room, surroundings, we loved taking dinner in a Mexican restaurant by a Venetian canal, ability to walk around all the hotels to take in the atmosphere"
144,"I loved my trip to Vegas this time round, I'm not a gambler and I found Vegas incredible even for the likes of me not going to gamble. The sites were amazing the Venetian hotel where my partner and I stayed was amazing. The pool beds and Tao beach bed rental I thought was extremely expensive for couples and we were residents at the hotel. A reduced price would have been better for couples rentinf. Big groups could have split price so ok for them. This is nout to do with hotel but I felt becos of the volumes of people living in Vegas as well as tourists coming in and out everyday. Traffic is crazy. I felt that the strip especially would really benefit with a bus and taxi lane. I think traffic would flow quicker. Overall I had a one of the best holidays ever. Defo stay at the Venetian hotel."
145,Amazing suite for standard room. Great pool. Lots of meal options from budget to fine dining. Stunning casino interior and exterior. Really like how entrance to elevators and pool area are manned and you have to show your room key.
146,The rooms were very spacious and luxurious.
147,Thank you for expert and professional service from your reservation department.  The reviews are that I read are correct and your hotel is outstanding.
148,"everything is near to you, no need to leave the hotelhuge clean rooms (all standard rooms are joiner suites) great staff,"
149,"The hotel was nice, and the bed was super comfortable."
150,Suite is standard so you get double the room size compared to most. The staff were fantastic. I had a problem with my credit card so they let me pay a small deposit in cash and told to I sort it in the morning without any fuss. By far the most spectacular inside.
151,"The hotel is classic, timeless and beautiful.  I was very happy to have booked this hotel after arriving and comparing the others in the strip."
152,"The house keeping crew were WONDERFUL! They are so sweet and helpful, they really made you feel like you were on vacation. If you like well crafted drinks we defiantly suggest the Dorsey, they are more $$$ but its a fun atmosphere. If you want the best breakfast of your life please go to Yard Bird, their Eggs Benedict and Bloody Mary's are amazing. Friendly staff, no complaints at all. It was our wedding weekend and they were all so accommodating."
153,"Big room, great location"
154,"Gondola ride, Dinner at Canaletto Italian Restaurant."

162,The hotel is beautiful .. loved the shops and views ..  The room was beautiful .. the bed was very comfortable ..
163,"Great location in the middle of the strip. Excellent food court with reasonably priced food outlets. We moved to the Pallazzo Tower day-2 which was much better. Free self parking option, 50SqFt bigger room, TV in the bathroom. Remote Ctrl Curtains. Strip Views."
164,"The location is Perfect. It's at the heart of most things though the cosmopolitan has some better in-hotel options I found myself leaving less and staying within the hotel vicinity more than when I stayed at Cosmo. The rooms are spacious and clean, well appointed and they even give you a fridge if you need it (you do need to request it from RS). The mall is grand and a sight to see for anyone traveling to Vegas, however that does make it more crowded. But not outside of convenience.  Restaurant selections are good. There is variety from good to great restaurants cheap options and expensive ones."
165,"Rooms were very spacious, well equipped and comfortable. The location on the Strip, proximity to the Fashion Mall, on-site shops, canals and decor of the Venetian were all incredible. We would stay there again without any hesitation. Price is what you pay, value is what you get - the Venetian is not cheap but is great value."
166,The overall ambiance of the hotel was wonderful from the details of architecture down to the accordion player in the lobby was realistic to visiting Italy.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The suites were spacious and the beds comfortable.
167,Location
168,The hotel restaurant food prices were reasonable
169,The size of the rooms. The casino is a much brighter one the rest on the strip. If you are looking for something with a bit more sparkle this is the hotel to stay in.

171,"We loved our luxurious suite, and spacious bathroom. The bed was comfty. Hotel grounds our beautiful."

177,"The location of the property is excellent, on the strip."
178,Location was nice and the room was spacious.
179,"excellent facilities, beautiful interior decorations, wide choice of restaurants and very spacious rooms."
180,The room was very comfortable and the cleanliness was great.
181,Everything from an early check in to a luggage gold made our vacation smooth and fun! The Venetian is  in a class of its own. Never once did we ever think we made the wrong choice. In fact we toured the strip and realized how great of a decision it was to stay at the Venetian. We're humble people from humble upbringings and we were happy with every penny spent!
182,Very convenient almost everything is around.
183,"Very nice and clean room, comfortable and spacious. Very beautiful canals and venetian-style interior. Quick check out."
184,Good hotel and location
185,"The room was massive! We had a king size bed (compfy & clean). The room looked exactly like the advertised pictures! The bathroom was beautiful, it had a separate backlit mirror for the lady's, which was much appreciated! The location of the hotel was great, right in the middle of the action, surrounded by many places to eat! The shopping is also great, located within the hotel, the offerings are mostly highend stores though, not a lot of variety! BUT if you want bargins you MUST go to North Premium Outlet!! It's a 10-15 minute taxi ride away, and it's worth it!! The savings on brand names such as guess, fossil, Ralph Lauren are crazy!! Such as 50% the entire fossil store, watches, handbags, everything! I would certainly recommend this hotel to family & friends!"
186,Huge room as in other reviews! Didnt need to leave hotel as everything under one roof - excellent restaurants and food. Bed was extremely comfy. Bathroom was huge too. Good location and beautiful surroundings.
187,Spacious room and bathroom
188,"PositiveThe granduer of the place makes you feel good when u walk in to check in.  The staff at the checkin is efficient n friendly.Room layout is the best in the strip.  We hv stayed in the Wynn n Ceasar before and we will give Venetian the thumps up.The food options n restaurent types are excellent.The location is great as it is easy to get to other hotels n also the bazaars.NegativeAs a hotel guest nothing is free n that makes you feel you are not a guest but a client.  I have to pay for kettle, wifi, indoor swimming pool and gym. We are most disappointed with room cleaning.  Socks n underwear on the floor were left as it is n the table n chairs are dusty. We suspect no vacumming is done.  This aspect displease us to a point that if we returned to Vegas again we will look at other hotels.We hope Venetian will look into this seriously."
189,The hotel was very clean and well decorated

213,"The Venetian is THE hotel I always promised myself I would stay at if I visited Vegas - it did not disappoint!We were given a room on the 25th floor by our very courteous and professional receptionist which turned out to have a partial Strip view. The suite was amazing - spacious, clean and very comfortable. The bed was HUGE and was the most comfortable one I have ever slept in in any hotel in the world!We loved the free valet parking where we were always treated in a polite and friendly manner.I was impressed with the cleanliness and upkeep of the rooms and all the public areas outside the casino - something I couldn't say about some of the other hotels we visited during our stay. It seems they take great pride in maintaining things to a very high standard - we even saw decorators in touching up some of the rooms.Overall The Venetian exceeded my expectations - I would not hesitate to recommend it."
214,"everything is fantastic ,location ,veiw, cleanliness, staff ,interior and exterior of the hotel"
215,"Great hotel in Vegas, super nice!"
216,"Room was amazing, as was the gym. Pool looked great, but it was too cold out to go in."

218,Conveniently located for my workGood size room
219,"This building is gorgeous! Every hallway, elevator, every bathroom, the pools, the gym were all immaculate! As soon as I checked in the staff offered a wide variety activities and specials in the hotel and on the strip. The room was nice a cozy and extremely spacious bathroom. For the ladies and the lades that like to do their make-up before a night out, the bathroom had a great vanity space with mirrors and great lighting. One last thing, Uber knew exactly were to pick us up and drop us off every time, very convenient pick-up/drop off locations. I can definitely see my family and friends staying here again."
220,The nicest hotel room and bathroom I've ever stayed in.  Whole resort was wonderful.
221,"The hotel was amazing.The best thing was the hotel has its own shopping mall, and lots of places to eat, so once you enter the hotel you don't need to leave."

223,"Suite was spacious, concierges were very nice and knowledgeable"
224,"Hotel was luxurious and comfortable. The room was very quiet and well appointed. We enjoyed the restaurants, shopping, and casino. Hotel's location is superb amidst the glitzy part of the Las Vegas strip."
225,"The stay at The Venetian was amazing. The hotel itself is super impressive. The staff are all very helpful and friendly and the rooms are incredible. The room itself had a living room, 2 TVs and the beds were incredibly comfortable. There is even a TV in the bathroom! The rooms are quiet as well despite the hotel being in the middle of Las Vegas Blvd.The hotel is amazing and huge - you can easily get lost in the casino or on the second level shops! But that just means there is a lot to do and see. Overall it's one of the coolest places I've ever stayed in Vegas. Highly recommended."
226,The hotel is stunning. They have thought of every single detail. The staff are all so friendly and helpful everywhere

236,The amount of space in the suites was wonderful and the bathroom was a delight. There was so much to see and do inside the complex comprising the two hotels with shops that we had everything we needed so we ended up never leaving the complex.
237,"The rooms are fabulous set on 2 levels. Large luxurious bathroom, super comfortable bed and a spacious lounge area set 3 steps down from the sleeping area. Televisions in all rooms including the bathroom and a telephone in the toilet!The hotel is vast with something new to see at the turn of every corner. The Grand Canale shopping area is spectacular and, having been to Venice, this re-creation is just right. The only thing missing is the smell!The hotel staff generally were very friendly and helpful exactly as you would expect."
238,The restaurants were ok!
239,Location is great
240,"I had ""a situation"" during the night and needed  one room around 3:00am, but had money only for one night due to some circumstances. Hotel offered me super early checkin for small price for view upgrade. Due to fact Venetian was fully booked, they moved me to Palazzo wchich was great."
241,"Extraordinary rooms, a luxurious bed, beautiful shower , simpley amazing place"
242,Almost everything
243,Architecture
244,The Venetian exceeded most if not all my expectations. The only issue I had was check in. I was not allowed to check in early due to room availability and I have always checked in early everywhere else I've stayed. What I liked most was the decor of the room. It was very appealing to the eye.
245,Location.
246,"As I had warned my wife, there is no other hotel even quite like this... The free parking was a plus, quite self explanatory, and all the options available in this hotel are unbelievable..."
247,Overall GREAT experience!
248,The staff was extremely friendly! The estimate check in wait was 3 hours but they got us in 30 mins after arrival. Anytime we needed anything the everyone was very helpful from concierges to operations. I usually stay at The Aria or Bellagio but I think The Venetian is my new  favorite! It's in the heart of everything and sooooooooo convenient to get where I need to get. This place is AMAZING from the decor to the comfortable beds! I'd highly suggest this place!

We had an early morning check-in and were given the option of a room straight away on the 12th floor or late afternoon check-in of a higher floor.....we took the 12th floor that had views of the Venetian Pool, some of the strip, and the mountains in the background. The suite was beautiful, very opulent, classy and roomy. The king sized bed was amazing and we slept well on it, the separate lounge area was great and the bathroom was also very classy.The is a stocked mini-bar in the room but no where to put your own drinks to cool.The hotel was just marvellous, the ceilings are decorated with Sistine chapel style paintings, the Grand Canal Shoppes had sky painted ceilings simulating outdoor areas at and the floors were even a fancy design to catch the eye. The Casino is vast but very open and well decorated."

277,Room was large and clean.  We upgraded for an additional charge for a room with a view Room service was excellent
278,The spa was fantastic! The fact that with a massage booking you get all-day access to all the spa facilities makes the massage prices actually pretty reasonable.

438,The hotel was really beautiful - a holiday in itself.  Everything is spotless and luxurious.  The beds are very comfy and the rooms are spacious and sumptuous.  Pay for a view room and ask for a high floor to see the city lights.  Allow time in your trip to spend in the hotel as it is huge and worth exploring.

The suites were amazing and so comfortable!  This is a hotel that works very hard to make sure their guests are well catered for and have a great time.

Staff were polite and efficient. There was always a good sense of being safe as security personnel were always on duty at all entrance points."
714,"Great location in the middle of the Strip and close to the Grand Canyon West Rim (2 hrs), Hoover Dam and Death Valley (2 hrs)"
715," clean and spacious suite with a nice, comfortable bed. The bathroom was fabulous with a separate shower and bath. I loved the arm rests meaning I could lie comfortably for ages. The pool area looked fantastic, though we didn't get chance to use it as we were out most days"
